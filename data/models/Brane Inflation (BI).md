# Brane Inflation (BI)

# Theoretical Justifications

This section is devoted to brane inflation, a class of models widely discussed in the literature [207, 417, 433, 464, 634-637, 637-647]. The idea is that inflation is caused by branes moving in the extra dimensions as it was already the case in TI, see section 6.9. For this reason, the setup is very similar to the one considered in that section. One starts from type IIB superstring theory where six dimensions are compactified. The effective, low energy, description of the model contains various fields among which are the dilaton, the axion and the (tensorial) gravitational field. One also has anti-symmetric fields with their corresponding field strength. The compact dimensions form a Calabi-Yau space and, generically, this Calabi-Yau space is made of a bulk plus throats attached to it. Along a given throat, a solution for the ten-dimensional metric is given by the conifold already discussed in section 6.9 whose metric is given in Eq. (6.142). In this equation, the metric  $\mathrm{ds}_5^2$  lives on the five-dimensional section  $\Sigma_5$  and  $r$  is the "radial" coordinate. In the following, we will denote by  $r_{\mathrm{UV}}$  the radial coordinate at which the cone is glued to the bulk and  $r_0$  the coordinate at the tip of the cone. The volume of the cone section is denoted by  $\mathrm{Vol}(\Sigma_5)$  and will be measured in terms of the volume of the five-dimensional sphere, namely

$$
v \equiv \frac {\operatorname {V o l} \left(\Sigma_ {5}\right)}{\operatorname {V o l} \left(S _ {5}\right)}. \tag {6.311}
$$

The geometry of the section  $\Sigma_5$  depends on the background fluxes, denoted by  $\mathcal{M}$  and  $\kappa$ , that are quantities related to the values of the anti-symmetric fields. If these fluxes vanish then the five-dimensional sections are simply given by  $S_{2} \times S_{3}$ . In that case, the conifold can be written as  $\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_{i}^{2} = 0$  where  $w_{i}$  are four complex coordinates, see also section 6.9. Moreover, an exact expression for the warp function  $h(r)$  can be found and reads

$$
h (r) = C _ {2} + \frac {C _ {1}}{r ^ {4}}, \tag {6.312}
$$

$C_1$  and  $C_2$  being constants. On the other hand, if the fluxes are turned on, then the background geometry responses accordingly and, as a consequence, the geometry of the cone is

modified. It is now given by a "deformed conifold",  $\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i^2 = z$ , where  $z$  is a number which depends on  $\mathcal{M}$  and  $\mathcal{K}$ . The warp function acquires a more complicated form and, obviously, becomes  $z$ -dependent, i.e.  $h(r,z)$ . The explicit form of this warp function is not needed here but it is interesting to notice that, far from the tip, one has  $h(r,z) \simeq h(r)$ . In other words, the modification of the extra-dimensional geometry due to the fluxes is significant only in the vicinity of the tip. Notice that, provided the depth of the throat is comparable to its width, the radial coordinate  $r_{\mathrm{UV}}$  can be expressed in terms of the quantity  $\mathcal{N} \equiv \mathcal{MK}$ . One obtains [648]

$$
r _ {\mathrm {U V}} ^ {4} = 4 \pi g _ {\mathrm {s}} \alpha^ {\prime 2} \frac {\mathcal {N}}{v}, \tag {6.313}
$$

where  $g_{\mathrm{s}}$  is the string coupling and  $\alpha^{\prime}\equiv \ell_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}$ $\ell_{\mathrm{s}}$  being the string length.

Finally, an anti- $D3$  brane is placed at the tip of the conifold, i.e. at the bottom of the throat. This brane is heavy and is supposed to slightly disturb the geometry of the throat in a way that has been calculated for instance in Refs. [207, 646, 649]. Then, in this geometry, one studies the motion of a light  $D3$  brane with tension

$$
T _ {3} = \frac {1}{(2 \pi) ^ {3} g _ {\mathrm {s}} \alpha^ {\prime 2}}. (6. 3 1 4)
$$

This brane is attracted by the anti- $D3$  brane and as a consequence moves radially along the throat. In principle it possesses a DBI kinetic term but one can show that, in the regime considered here, it always reduces to an ordinary, minimal, kinetic term, see Ref. [207]. If  $r$  represents the distance between the two branes, then the effective Lagrangian of the system can be expressed as

$$
\mathcal {L} = - \frac {1}{2} \left(\frac {\partial \phi}{\partial t}\right) ^ {2} - \frac {2 T _ {3} r _ {0} ^ {4}}{r _ {\mathrm {U V}} ^ {4}} \left(1 - \frac {r _ {0} ^ {4} T _ {3} ^ {2}}{\mathcal {N}} \frac {1}{\phi^ {4}}\right), \tag {6.315}
$$

where  $\phi \equiv \sqrt{T_3} r$ . The shape of the potential is now completely fixed and the behavior  $\propto \phi^{-4}$  is of course due to the particular scaling  $\propto r^{-4}$  of the warp function given by Eq. (6.312).

In order to be valid, the effective model described above must satisfy some conditions that we now discuss in more detail. Defining  $\phi_0\equiv \sqrt{T_3} r_0$  and  $\phi_{\mathrm{UV}}\equiv \sqrt{T_3} r_{\mathrm{UV}}$ , it is clear that the presence of the brane in the throat implies that  $\phi_0 < \phi < \phi_{\mathrm{UV}}$ . In addition, as discussed for instance in Ref. [207], from the trivial fact that the volume of the throat,  $V_{6}^{\mathrm{throat}} = 2\pi^{4}g_{\mathrm{s}}\mathcal{N}\alpha^{\prime 2}r_{\mathrm{UV}}^{2}$ , cannot be bigger than the volume of the total Calabi-Yau manifold  $V_{6}^{\mathrm{tot}}$ , one can derive the bound

$$
\phi_ {\mathrm {U V}} <   \frac {m _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\sqrt {2 \pi \mathcal {N}}}, \tag {6.316}
$$

where the Planck mass can be expressed as  $m_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 = 8\pi V_6^{\mathrm{tot}} / \kappa_{10}$  and  $\kappa_{10} = (2\pi)^7 g_{\mathrm{s}}^2\alpha'^4 /2$ . Another constraint comes from the fact that the effective model is valid only if the proper distance between the two branes is larger than the Planck length. One can show, see Ref. [207], that this means  $r > r_{\mathrm{stg}}$  where

$$
r _ {\mathrm {s t g}} \equiv r _ {0} e ^ {\sqrt {\alpha^ {\prime}} / r _ {\mathrm {U V}}}. \tag {6.317}
$$

In particular, as will be seen in the following, the value of  $r_{\mathrm{stg}}$  plays an important role regarding the mechanism ending inflation. In the next section, we carry out the slow-roll analysis of this model.

Let us also mention that the same potential arises in the context of tachyon inflation [650, 651], in the context of SQCD inflation [652] and in the context of the strong coupling limit of twisted models of SQCD inflation, (see TWI, section 6.5 and Ref. [568]). It

is also worth noticing that the same kind of inverse power law potential is sometimes used in quintessence models [361, 624, 625]. The brane inflation potential can also receive power law corrections [653] with either positive (UV models) or negative sign (IR models). The UV case is similar to RIPI models while the IR corresponds to SFI models.

# Slow-Roll Analysis

We now turn to the slow-roll analysis of BI. For this purpose, it is more convenient to re-write the potential appearing in Eq. (6.315) in the following way

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ 1 - \left(\frac {\phi}{\mu}\right) ^ {- p} \right], \tag {6.318}
$$

where  $\mu$  and  $p$  are free parameters. Compared to Eq. (6.315), we have generalized by hand the expression of  $V(\phi)$  by considering an arbitrary  $p$ . In such a way, this potential can be viewed as a generalization of the small field models to negative values of  $p$  (see section 6.1). In the following, we will also consider the non-approximated KKLT potential

$$
V (\phi) = \frac {M ^ {4}}{1 + \left(\frac {\phi}{\mu}\right) ^ {- p}}, \tag {6.319}
$$

from which (6.318) is the  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  limit.

In the context of the brane inflationary scenario, the value  $p = 4$  is special in the sense that, as explained above, it corresponds to the motion of a test  $D3$  brane in a warped throat and is, therefore, a case of physical interest. Let us notice that the parameters of the potential are related to their stringy counterparts by

$$
M ^ {4} = \frac {2 T _ {3} r _ {0} ^ {4}}{r _ {\mathrm {U V}} ^ {4}} = \frac {4 \pi^ {2} v}{\mathcal {N}} \phi_ {0} ^ {4}, \qquad \mu^ {4} = \frac {T _ {3} ^ {2} r _ {0} ^ {4}}{\mathcal {N}} = \frac {M ^ {4}}{4 \pi^ {2} v}. (6. 3 2 0)
$$

Moreover, brane inflation proceeds under the condition  $\mu /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\ll 1$ . Indeed, using the formulas established in the previous subsection, it is easy to show that

$$
\frac {\mu^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} = \frac {1}{\mathcal {N}} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} <   \frac {1}{\mathcal {N}} \left(\frac {\phi_ {\mathrm {U V}}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} <   \frac {1 6}{\mathcal {N} ^ {3}} \ll 1, \tag {6.321}
$$

where we have used the condition  $\phi_0 < \phi_{\mathrm{UV}}$  and Eq. (6.316). Finally, let us stress that the brane motion in the throat ends by a tachyonic instabilities at  $\phi = \phi_{\mathrm{stg}}$ . As we discuss below, the observable predictions of the model crucially depend on whether the universe is still inflating at  $\phi \gtrsim \phi_{\mathrm{stg}}$ , or not. Therefore, in the context of string theory, we necessarily have  $\mu / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \ll 1$ ,  $p = 4$  and an additional model parameter  $\phi_{\mathrm{stg}}$ .

In the following, we will first consider arbitrary values for  $\mu$  and  $p$  viewing Eq. (6.318) as a phenomenological potential in which  $\phi_{\mathrm{stg}}$  has no meaning, and then, the discussion will be focused on the stringy scenario. BI is another proto-typical case exemplifying how two models having exactly the same potential can lead to different observable predictions. Here this will be due to the mechanism ending inflation.

The potential (6.318), as well as its logarithm, are displayed in Fig. 84. It is an increasing function of the field, hence inflation proceeds from the right to the left. It vanishes for  $\phi / \mu = 1$

and, hence, it should be studied in the  $\phi / \mu > 1$  region only. Let us calculate the slow-roll parameters. Defining the quantity  $x$  by the following expression

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{\mu}, \tag {6.322}
$$

one can express the first three Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation as

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}\right) ^ {2} \frac {p ^ {2}}{2 x ^ {2} (1 - x ^ {p}) ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = 2 p \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}\right) ^ {2} \frac {(1 + p) x ^ {p} - 1}{x ^ {2} (1 - x ^ {p}) ^ {2}}, \tag {6.323}
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_ {3} = p \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}\right) ^ {2} \frac {2 + (p - 4) (p + 1) x ^ {p} + (1 + p) (2 + p) x ^ {2 p}}{x ^ {2} (1 - x ^ {p}) ^ {2} [ (1 + p) x ^ {p} - 1 ]}. \tag {6.324}
$$

These functions are displayed in Fig. 84. They become very small at large fields  $x \gg 1$ , and diverge when the potential vanishes at  $x \rightarrow 1$ . Therefore inflation can naturally end with slow-roll violation at a field value  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , solution of  $\epsilon_1(x_{\mathrm{end}}) = 1$ , i.e., verifying

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {p + 1} - x _ {\text {e n d}} = \frac {p}{\sqrt {2}} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}. \tag {6.325}
$$

Unless  $p$  takes integer values, this equation has to be solved numerically (see also section 6.1).

However, in the limits  $\mu / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \ll 1$  and  $\mu / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \gg 1$  we can find an approximate expression for  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . Solving perturbatively the equation  $\epsilon_1 = 1$ , one obtains

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} \underset {\mu \ll M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} {\simeq} \left(\frac {p M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\sqrt {2} \mu}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{p + 1}} + \frac {1}{p + 1} \left(\frac {p M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\sqrt {2} \mu}\right) ^ {\frac {1 - p}{1 + p}}, \quad x _ {\text {e n d}} \underset {\mu \gg M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} {\simeq} 1 + \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu} - \frac {p + 1}{4} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}}. \tag {6.326}
$$

It is also interesting to find the solution of  $\epsilon_{2} = 1$ . As before, this cannot be done exactly but, perturbatively, one obtains

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 1} \underset {\mu \ll M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} {\simeq} \left[ 2 p (1 + p) \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}\right) ^ {2} \right] ^ {\frac {1}{p + 2}}, \quad x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 1} \underset {\mu \gg M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} {\simeq} 1 + \sqrt {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}. \tag {6.327}
$$

From the above expressions, we deduce that slow-roll violation always occurs before the end of inflation, that is to say  $\epsilon_{2}$  becomes unity before  $\epsilon_{1}$ . This has not effect on the observable predictions since only a few  $e$ -folds of inflation are spent in this regime (see Fig. 84).

The slow-roll trajectory can be integrated explicitly from Eq. (3.11) and one obtains

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = \frac {\mu^ {2}}{2 p M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left(x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} - \frac {2}{p + 2} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {p + 2} - x ^ {2} + \frac {2}{p + 2} x ^ {p + 2}\right), \tag {6.328}
$$

an expression which cannot be inverted in general. However, in the  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  and  $\mu \gg M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  limits, one has  $x \gg 1$  and  $x \simeq 1$  respectively and the previous equation can be approximately inverted leading to the following expressions

$$
x _ {*} \underset {\mu \ll M _ {P 1}} {\simeq} \left[ p (p + 2) \frac {M _ {P 1} ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}} \Delta N _ {*} + x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {p + 2} \right] ^ {\frac {1}{p + 2}}, \quad x _ {*} \underset {\mu \gg M _ {P 1}} {\simeq} 1 + \frac {M _ {P 1}}{\mu} \sqrt {\frac {1}{2} + 2 \Delta N _ {*}}, \tag {6.329}
$$

where use has been made of Eq. (6.326). Also, making use of the full KKLT potential (6.319), the slow roll trajectory reads

$$
N _ {\text {e n d}} - N = \frac {\mu^ {2}}{2 p M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left(- x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2} - \frac {2}{p + 2} x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {p + 2} + x ^ {2} + \frac {2}{p + 2} x ^ {p + 2}\right), \tag {6.330}
$$

which coincides with (6.328) in the limit  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$

The mass scale  $M$  is given by the CMB normalization and verifies

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} p ^ {2} \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}\right) ^ {2} \frac {x _ {*} ^ {p - 2}}{\left(x _ {*} ^ {p} - 1\right) ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s} - \mathrm {P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.331}
$$

which can be further simplified in the appropriate limits using Eqs. (6.326) and (6.329).

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the phenomenological models are displayed in Figs. 254, 255, 256 for  $p = 2$ ,  $p = 3$  and  $p = 4$ , respectively, and with  $\mu / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \in [10^{-3}, 10^{3}]$ . The reheating equation of state parameter  $\overline{w}_{\mathrm{reh}} = 0$  but since the shape of the potential is unknown at  $x < 1$ , this parameter is a priori unspecified and could take different values. For small values of  $\mu$ , we see that  $n_{\mathrm{S}} \simeq 0.96$  and  $r \ll 1$ . In the opposite case,  $\mu \gg M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the model predictions lie around  $\epsilon_2 \simeq 4\epsilon_1$  with  $n_{\mathrm{S}} \simeq 0.97$  and  $r \simeq 0.08$ . These

behaviors can be recovered by plugging the approximated expressions given in Eqs. (6.326) and (6.329) into the Hubble flow functions. For  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , one obtains

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \simeq \frac {p ^ {2}}{2} \left[ p (p + 2) \Delta N _ {*} \right] ^ {- \frac {2 p + 2}{p + 2}} \left(\frac {\mu}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {\frac {2 p}{p + 2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2 *} \simeq \frac {2}{\Delta N _ {*}} \frac {p + 1}{p + 2}, \quad \epsilon_ {3 *} \simeq \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*}}, (6. 3 3 2)
$$

and the spectral index is of the order  $n_{\mathrm{S}} \simeq 1 - 2 / \Delta N_{*}(p + 1) / (p + 2) \sim 0.96$  with  $r \ll 1$ . Similarly, for  $\mu \gg M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  limit, the Hubble flow parameters at Hubble crossing behave as

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \simeq \frac {1}{4 \Delta N _ {*}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2 *} \simeq \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \quad \epsilon_ {3 *} \simeq \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*}}. \tag {6.333}
$$

Therefore, the predicted level of gravity waves is now of the order  $r \simeq 4 / \Delta N_{*} \simeq 0.08$  and the spectral index is  $n_{\mathrm{s}} \simeq 1 - 3 / (2\Delta N_{*}) \simeq 0.97$ , which is again in agreement with the numerical results.

Finally, the predictions for the KKLTI models, i.e. using the full potential (6.319), are displayed in Figs. 258, 259, 260 for the same parameters. One can see that they deviate from the ones of brane inflation only when  $\mu \gg M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ .

# Slow-Roll Analysis of the Stringy Scenario

In the case where the model is interpreted as a stringy scenario, with  $p = 4$ , we have seen before that the low energy description is valid provided  $r > r_{\mathrm{stg}}$ , or  $x > x_{\mathrm{stg}}$  with

$$
x _ {\mathrm {s t g}} \equiv \frac {\sqrt {T _ {3}} r _ {\mathrm {s t g}}}{\mu} = \mathcal {N} ^ {1 / 4} \exp \left[ \left(4 \pi g _ {\mathrm {s}} \frac {\mathcal {N}}{v}\right) ^ {- 1 / 4} \right]. \tag {6.334}
$$

If slow-roll violation occurs before the system reaches  $x_{\mathrm{stg}}$ , then the effective string description is always valid and the observable predictions will be exactly the same as those derived in the previous paragraph (for  $p = 4$  and  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ ). However, if, on the contrary, slow-roll violation occurs after the field crosses the value  $x_{\mathrm{stg}}$ , then inflation stops by instability at  $x_{\mathrm{stg}}$  instead of the naively expected  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . Indeed, in this case, a tachyon appears and triggers the process of branes annihilation. Therefore, the mechanism ending inflation in this model depends on whether slow-roll violation occurs in a regime where the distance between the branes is larger or smaller than the string length. And this question depends on the value of the parameters characterizing BI. One can determine the two regimes by evaluating the ratio

$$
\frac {x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 1}}{x _ {\mathrm {s t g}}} = 4 0 ^ {1 / 6} \left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {- 1 / 3} \mathcal {N} ^ {- 1 / 4} (4 \pi^ {2} v) ^ {1 / 1 2} \exp \left[ - \left(4 \pi g _ {\mathrm {s}} \frac {\mathcal {N}}{v}\right) ^ {- 1 / 4} \right], \tag {6.335}
$$

in which we have used Eqs. (6.320), (6.327) and (6.334) (with  $p = 4$  and  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ ). If this ratio is larger than one, inflation stops by slow-roll violation and if it is smaller than one by instability. The complicated part of the analysis lies in the fact that the above equation depends on the mass scale  $M$ . In order to have an explicit expression of  $M$  in terms of the parameters of the model, one must first CMB normalize the model which, in turn, requires the knowledge of the mechanism ending inflation. However, we are interested in calculating the frontier where  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 1} = x_{\mathrm{stg}}$  and, therefore, the two possible mechanisms for stopping inflation coincide in that case. Replacing  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  by  $x_{\mathrm{stg}} = x_{\epsilon_2 = 1}$  in Eq. (6.329) yields

$$
x _ {*} ^ {\mathrm {f}} \simeq \left[ 2 4 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}} \left(\Delta N _ {*} + \frac {5}{3}\right) \right] ^ {1 / 6}, \tag {6.336}
$$

from which one can obtain an explicit formula for the first slow-roll coefficient (6.323) at Hubble radius crossing

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} ^ {\mathrm {f}} \simeq 8 \left[ 2 4 \left(\Delta N _ {*} + \frac {5}{3}\right) \right] ^ {- 5 / 3} \left(\frac {\mu}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4 / 3}. \tag {6.337}
$$

Comparing this expression to Eq. (6.332), we see that there is a very small shift by  $5/3$  in  $\Delta N_*$ . It accounts for the difference of  $e$ -folds between the time at which slow-roll violations occur, i.e. for  $x = x_{\epsilon_2 = 1}$ , and the end of inflation at  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . As argued before, we see that these effects are too small to be observable and completely degenerated with the reheating duration. Plugging this expression into the CMB normalization, and using the relation  $M^4 = 4\pi^2 v\mu^4$ , one arrives at the following expression for  $M$

$$
\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} = C \left(4 \pi^ {2} v\right) ^ {- 1 / 8} \left(\Delta N _ {*} + \frac {5}{3}\right) ^ {- 5 / 8}, \tag {6.338}
$$

where we have defined

$$
C \equiv 3 ^ {- 5 / 8} (8 \pi^ {2} Q _ {*}) ^ {3 / 8}, \qquad Q _ {*} \equiv 4 5 \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}} = 2 7 0 0 P _ {*}. \tag {6.339}
$$

We can now insert this expression of  $M$  in Eq. (6.335) to get the equation defining the frontier in the string parameter space, namely

$$
\left. \frac {x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 1}}{x _ {\mathrm {s t g}}} \right| _ {\mathrm {f}} = 1 = \left(\frac {4 0}{C ^ {2}}\right) ^ {1 / 6} \left(\Delta N _ {*} + \frac {5}{3}\right) ^ {5 / 2 4} (4 \pi^ {2} v) ^ {1 / 8} \mathcal {N} ^ {- 1 / 4} \exp \left[ - \left(4 \pi g _ {\mathrm {s}} \frac {\mathcal {N}}{v}\right) ^ {- 1 / 4} \right]. \tag {6.340}
$$

Following Ref. [207], if one defines the two following rescaled stringy parameters

$$
y \equiv 4 \pi g _ {\mathrm {s}} \frac {\mathcal {N}}{v}, \quad \bar {v} \equiv \frac {v}{\left(4 \pi g _ {\mathrm {s}}\right) ^ {2}}, \tag {6.341}
$$

then the frontier (6.340) is defined by the following "universal" form

$$
y ^ {1 / 4} e ^ {y ^ {- 1 / 4}} \bar {v} ^ {1 / 8} - \left(\frac {4 0}{C ^ {2}}\right) ^ {1 / 6} \left(\Delta N _ {*} + \frac {5}{3}\right) ^ {5 / 2 4} (4 \pi^ {2}) ^ {1 / 8} = 0, \tag {6.342}
$$

which is independent of the string coupling  $g_{\mathrm{s}}$ . As represented in Fig. 85, in the plane  $(y,\bar{v})$ , this relation is a curve that separates the region where inflation stops by slow-roll violation (below the curve) and the region where inflation stops by instability due to brane annihilation (above the curve).

The requirement of having the throat contained within the Calabi-Yau manifold can equally be written in terms of the universal variables. From Eqs. (6.316) and (6.341), one gets

$$
y ^ {3 / 2} \bar {v} <   8 \pi^ {2} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} \ell_ {\mathrm {s}} ^ {2}, \tag {6.343}
$$

which therefore depends on the string length  $\ell_{\mathrm{s}} = \sqrt{\alpha'}$  but not on the string coupling  $g_{\mathrm{s}}$ .

Finally, the last theoretical prior comes from requiring that the brane motion remains located inside the throat, i.e.  $x < x_{\mathrm{UV}}$  with

$$
x _ {\mathrm {U V}} \equiv \frac {\sqrt {T _ {3}} r _ {\mathrm {U V}}}{\mu} = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{M} \left(\frac {\mathcal {N}}{4 \pi^ {3} \alpha^ {\prime 2} g _ {\mathrm {s}}}\right) ^ {1 / 4}. \tag {6.344}
$$

Since during inflation  $x$  decreases, this condition gives an upper limit on the admissible initial field values. However, the initial field values depend on the total number of  $e$ -folds of inflation, say  $\Delta N_{\mathrm{tot}}$ , and on the field value at which inflation ends, i.e. either  $x_{\mathrm{stg}}$  or  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 1}$  depending on if brane annihilation occurs before slow-roll violations.

Let us first assume that brane annihilation occurs well after the end of inflation, i.e. we are in lower part of the string parameter space  $(y,\bar{v})$  separated by Eq. (6.342). For the relevant limit,  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the initial field value is given by

$$
x _ {\mathrm {i n i}} ^ {\epsilon_ {2}} \simeq \left[ 2 4 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}} \left(\Delta N _ {\mathrm {t o t}} + \frac {5}{3}\right) \right] ^ {1 / 6}. \tag {6.345}
$$

This expression involves  $\mu$  and therefore  $M$  through Eq. (6.320). Again, one has to determine  $M$  using the CMB normalization and we are assuming that inflation ends at  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 1}$ , i.e. exactly

Eq. (6.338). Plugging everything together and making use of the universal variables, one gets

$$
y \bar {v} _ {x _ {\mathrm {s t g}} <   x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 1}} C ^ {8 / 3} \pi^ {2} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} \ell_ {\mathrm {s}} ^ {4} \left[ 2 4 \left(\Delta N _ {\mathrm {t o t}} + \frac {5}{3}\right) \right] ^ {2 / 3} \left(\Delta N _ {*} + \frac {5}{3}\right) ^ {- 5 / 3}. \tag {6.346}
$$

If inflation ends by brane annihilation at  $x = x_{\mathrm{stg}}$ , i.e. the string parameters  $(y, \bar{v})$  lie above the curve given by Eq. (6.338), then  $x_{\mathrm{ini}}$  and  $x_*$  are accordingly modified. For  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , their new expressions are however still given by Eq. (6.329), up to the replacement  $x_{\mathrm{end}} \rightarrow x_{\mathrm{stg}}$ , i.e.

$$
x _ {\mathrm {i n i}} ^ {\mathrm {s t g}} \simeq \left(2 4 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}} \Delta N _ {\mathrm {t o t}} + x _ {\mathrm {s t g}} ^ {6}\right) ^ {1 / 6}, \quad x _ {*} ^ {\mathrm {s t g}} \simeq \left(2 4 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}} \Delta N _ {*} + x _ {\mathrm {s t g}} ^ {6}\right) ^ {1 / 6}. \tag {6.347}
$$

As before,  $x_{\mathrm{ini}}^{\mathrm{stg}}$  and  $x_{*}^{\mathrm{stg}}$  depend on  $\mu$  and therefore on  $M$ , which is determined by the CMB normalization. However, since inflation now ends by tachyonic instability this one has to be re-determined by plugging  $x_{*}^{\mathrm{stg}}$  into Eq. (6.331). Doing so gives an implicit expression for  $M$

$$
\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} \simeq C (4 \pi^ {2} v) ^ {- 1 / 8} \left(\Delta N _ {*} + \frac {\mu^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \frac {x _ {\mathrm {s t g}} ^ {6}}{2 4}\right) ^ {- 5 / 8} = C (4 \pi^ {2} v) ^ {- 1 / 8} \left[ \Delta N _ {*} + \frac {5}{3} \left(\frac {x _ {\mathrm {s t g}}}{x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 1}}\right) ^ {6} \right] ^ {- 5 / 8}, \tag {6.348}
$$

where use has been made of Eq. (6.327), for  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ . This equation cannot be analytically solved for  $M$  because  $\mu$ , and  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 1}$ , depends on  $M$ . However, if brane annihilation occurs well before slow-roll violation, one has  $x_{\mathrm{stg}} \gg x_{\epsilon_2 = 1}$  such that the term in  $\Delta N_*$  can be neglected. In that situation, from  $\mu^4 = M^4 / (4\pi^2 v)$ , one gets the approximate expression

$$
\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} \underset {x _ {\mathrm {s t g}} \gg x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 1}} {\simeq} 2 4 ^ {5 / 1 8} C ^ {4 / 9} \left(4 \pi^ {2} v\right) ^ {1 / 1 2} x _ {\mathrm {s t g}} ^ {- 5 / 3}. \tag {6.349}
$$

Requiring  $x_{\mathrm{ini}}^{\mathrm{stg}} < x_{\mathrm{UV}}$  finally yields

$$
y ^ {1 9 / 6} \bar {v} ^ {7 / 3} \exp \left(\frac {2 0}{3} y ^ {- 1 / 4}\right) _ {x _ {\mathrm {s t g}} \gg x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 1}} > \left(8 \pi^ {2} \ell_ {\mathrm {s}} ^ {2}\right) ^ {3} Q _ {*} \left[ y ^ {2 / 3} \bar {v} ^ {1 / 3} \exp \left(\frac {8}{3} y ^ {- 1 / 4}\right) + \frac {6 \Delta N _ {\mathrm {t o t}}}{Q _ {*} ^ {1 / 3}} \right], \tag {6.350}
$$

which completes the bounds coming from  $x_{\mathrm{UV}}$ .

Brane inflation within the string scenario has therefore a rather involved set of priors. In addition to have  $p = 4$  and  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the model parameters should simultaneously verify Eq. (6.343) and either Eq. (6.346), or Eq. (6.350), according to the sign of the left hand side of Eq. (6.342). All these equations involve the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies, which is well measured, the total number of  $e$ -folds  $\Delta N_{\mathrm{tot}}$ , which is an unknown quantity, and the number of  $e$ -folds  $\Delta N_*$  before the end of inflation at which the pivot mode crossed the Hubble radius. As discussed in section 3.2,  $\Delta N_*$  can only be obtained by solving Eq. (3.45), i.e. after having specified the reheating parameter. As the result, the reheating slow-roll predictions for the string scenario can only be sorted out numerically, paying attention that for a given reheating history, all of the previous theoretical constraints are satisfied. As an illustration, we have plotted in Fig. 85 the bounds for the typical values  $\Delta N_* = 50$  and  $\Delta N_{\mathrm{tot}} = 60$  with  $\alpha' M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 \simeq 1/4$  [207, 654].

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the string models are displayed in Figs. 257 for a set of realistic fundamental parameters. Also, making use of the full potential (6.319), the predictions of the corresponding KKLT inflation models are displayed in Figs. 261. One can check that they match perfectly.
