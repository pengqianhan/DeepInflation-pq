# Brane SUSY Breaking Inflation (BSUSYBI)

This model has been studied in Ref. [576] in the context of superstrings models<sup>8</sup>. The potential is a sum of two exponential terms

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left(e ^ {\sqrt {6} \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}} + e ^ {\sqrt {6} \gamma \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}}\right), \tag {6.133}
$$

one is a "hard" exponential brought about by a SUSY breaking mechanism and the other is a "slow-roll term" having  $0 < \gamma < 1 / \sqrt{3}$  and that dominates the eventual inflationary

dynamics. It was shown in Ref. [576] that the inflationary dynamics can also generate superimposed oscillations in the primordial power spectrum but we will not focus on this case since, obviously, slow-roll is not satisfied in this situation [577-579]. Let us also notice that if the term in  $\sqrt{6}$  in the first exponential function is relaxed to be a free parameter, the potential becomes as in Ref. [580], i.e. a general exponential brane potential. Defining

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}, \tag {6.134}
$$

the first three Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation read

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = 3 \left(\frac {e ^ {\sqrt {6} x} + \gamma e ^ {\sqrt {6} \gamma x}}{e ^ {\sqrt {6} x} + e ^ {\sqrt {6} \gamma x}}\right) ^ {2}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = - 1 2 (\gamma - 1) ^ {2} \frac {e ^ {\sqrt {6} (\gamma + 1) x}}{\left(e ^ {\sqrt {6} x} + e ^ {\sqrt {6} \gamma x}\right) ^ {2}}, \tag {6.135}
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_ {3} = 6 (1 - \gamma) \frac {\left(e ^ {\sqrt {6} x} - e ^ {\sqrt {6} \gamma x}\right) \left(e ^ {\sqrt {6} x} + \gamma e ^ {\sqrt {6} \gamma x}\right)}{\left(e ^ {\sqrt {6} x} + e ^ {\sqrt {6} \gamma x}\right) ^ {2}}. \tag {6.136}
$$

These functions together with the potential are displayed in Fig. 69. The two exponential components are clearly visible on the plot of the logarithm of the potential. The required flatness of the potential is realized only along the  $\gamma$  branch and for negative values of  $x$ . The first Hubble flow function  $\epsilon_{1}$  is an increasing function of  $x$  which varies between its asymptotic values:

$$
\lim  _ {x \rightarrow - \infty} \epsilon_ {1} = 3 \gamma^ {2}, \quad \lim  _ {x \rightarrow + \infty} \epsilon_ {1} = 3. \tag {6.137}
$$

For  $\gamma$  small enough ( $\gamma < 1/\sqrt{3}$ ), there is a regime where it is less than unity. This regime is given by the condition  $x < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  with

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {1} = 1} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {6} (\gamma - 1)} \ln \left(\frac {\sqrt {3} - 1}{1 - \gamma \sqrt {3}}\right). \tag {6.138}
$$

As a result, inflation can only proceed in the domain  $x < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  and it never stops. Hence the need for an extra-parameter  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  encoding the field value at which some unspecified mechanism (such as a tachyonic instability) is triggered and stops inflation. Let us notice that the slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{2}$  is always negative and goes to zero at large  $|x|$  with a local minimum in  $x = 0$  equals to  $\epsilon_2^{\min} = -3(\gamma -1)^2$ . Finally, the slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{3}$  vanishes when  $x = 0$  and shares the same sign as  $x$ . Its asymptotic values are

$$
\lim  _ {x \rightarrow - \infty} \epsilon_ {3} = 6 \gamma (\gamma - 1), \quad \lim  _ {x \rightarrow + \infty} \epsilon_ {3} = 6 (1 - \gamma). \tag {6.139}
$$

The slow-roll trajectory can be integrated and gives

$$
N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = - \frac {1}{\sqrt {6}} (x - x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}) + \frac {1}{6 \gamma} \ln \left[ \frac {1 + \gamma e ^ {\sqrt {6} (\gamma - 1) x}}{1 + \gamma e ^ {\sqrt {6} (\gamma - 1) x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}} \right]. \qquad (6. 1 4 0)
$$

This equation cannot be analytically inverted but since inflation requires  $x < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$ , it shows that  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  should not be too close to  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  in order to realize enough  $e$ -folds of inflation. This puts some upper bound on  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , that can be computed numerically and that is displayed in Fig. 70. This value  $x_{\mathrm{end}}^{\max}$  defines a prior for the model parameter  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , which is the region lying under the curves on the figure.

Integrating Eq. (3.48) finally gives the field value  $x_{*}$  at which the pivot mode crossed the Hubble radius during inflation. The parameter  $M$  being fixed by the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 4 3 2 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {\left(e ^ {\sqrt {6} x _ {*}} + \gamma e ^ {\sqrt {6} \gamma x _ {*}}\right) ^ {2}}{\left(e ^ {\sqrt {6} x _ {*}} + e ^ {\sqrt {6} \gamma x _ {*}}\right) ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.141}
$$

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions of the BSUSYBI models have been plotted in Fig. 199. The parameter  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  varies between  $2x_{\mathrm{end}}^{\mathrm{max}} < x_{\mathrm{end}} < x_{\mathrm{end}}^{\mathrm{max}}$  with  $x_{\mathrm{end}}^{\mathrm{max}} < 0$ , under which the predictions of the model coincide with those of PLI (see section 5.8). Large values for the parameter  $\gamma$  are disfavored and it has to be smaller than  $\lesssim 5 \times 10^{-2}$  to generate a reasonable amount of gravitational waves.
