# Constant Spectrum Inflation (CSI)

This potential belongs to the class of models discussed in Ref. [596] and is constructed in order to produce a power spectrum  $P(k) \propto k^0$  for the primordial density fluctuations, i.e. a power spectrum with constant spectral index such that  $n_{\mathrm{S}} = 1$  (exact scale invariance). It reads

$$
V (\phi) = \frac {M ^ {4}}{\left(1 - \alpha \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2}}. \tag {6.220}
$$

There is a symmetry for  $\phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\to 2 / \alpha -\phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  and inflation can proceed indifferently in the branch  $\phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}} < 1 / \alpha$  or in the branch  $\phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}} > 1 / \alpha$ , leading to the same physical predictions. For this reason, in the following, we will be interested in the branch  $\phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}} < 1 / \alpha$ . Defining the quantity  $x$  by

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}, \tag {6.221}
$$

the first three Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {2 \alpha^ {2}}{(\alpha x - 1) ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \epsilon_ {3} = - 2 \epsilon_ {1}. \tag {6.222}
$$

The previous relation  $\epsilon_{2} = -2\epsilon_{1}$  means that, at first order in slow-roll, the spectral index is indeed equals to unity,  $n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 = 0$ . Recall that the potential of this model is precisely constructed in order for this relation to be true. Let us notice, however, that, at second order in slow-roll,  $\epsilon_{2} = \epsilon_{3} = -2\epsilon_{1}$  yields  $n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 = 4\epsilon_{1}^{2} > 0$ . One should note that another way to realize  $n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 = 0$  at first order in slow-roll is to take the large field inflation potential LFI (see section 5.2) with a negative power index  $p = -2$ . In that case one also has  $\epsilon_{2} = \epsilon_{3} = -2\epsilon_{1}$  and, at second order,  $n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 = 4\epsilon_{1}^{2}$  is also verified. However, since the explicit expressions of  $\epsilon_{1}$  for CSI and LFI ( $p = -2$ ) are different, the actual value of the spectral index at second order is also different. The potential and the Hubble flow functions have been represented in Fig. 75.

As can be checked in this figure,  $\epsilon_{1}$  is a monotonic function of  $x$  in both branches of the potential. It diverges at  $x = 1 / \alpha$  and vanishes for  $x\to \pm \infty$ . Inflation can therefore take place in the region  $x < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^-$  for the branch  $x < 1 / \alpha$  (or  $x > x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^+$  for the branch  $x > 1 / \alpha$ ),

where  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^{\pm}$  are the field values at which  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {1} = 1} ^ {\pm} = \frac {1 \pm \sqrt {2} \alpha}{\alpha}. \tag {6.223}
$$

Since the field evolution proceeds from the right to the left from  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^{\pm}$ , inflation does not stop by slow-roll violation and an extra mechanism parametrized by  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  should be considered in order to end it. For this reason, CSI is in fact a two parameters model. Let us also notice that the slow-roll parameters  $\epsilon_{2} = \epsilon_{3}$  are negative monotonic functions of  $x$  in both branches of the potential and cross the line  $\epsilon_{2} = \epsilon_{3} = -1$  at

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = - 1} ^ {\pm} = x _ {\epsilon_ {3} = - 1} ^ {\pm} = \frac {1 \pm 2 \alpha}{\alpha}. \tag {6.224}
$$

As a result, there is a small domain  $x_{\epsilon_2 = -1}^- < x < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^-$  where we have inflation but where the slow-roll approximation is violated (this is also true for the other branch). This is not problematic since the system is driven away from this regime towards a situation in which all the Hubble flow functions become small (see Fig. 75).

The slow-roll trajectory can be integrated explicitly and reads

$$
N _ {\text {e n d}} - N = - \frac {x ^ {2}}{4} + \frac {x}{2 \alpha} + \frac {x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2}}{4} - \frac {x _ {\text {e n d}}}{2 \alpha}. \tag {6.225}
$$

It can also be inverted analytically and it follows that

$$
x = \frac {1 \pm \sqrt {1 - 2 \alpha x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} + \alpha^ {2} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} + 4 \alpha^ {2} (N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}})}}{\alpha}. \tag {6.226}
$$

The sign  $\mp$  depends on whether one works in the  $x < 1 / \alpha$  branch or in the  $x > 1 / \alpha$  branch, respectively. A consequence of this formula is the fact that, if one requires  $N_{\mathrm{end}} - N_{\mathrm{ini}}$ $e$ -folds during inflation, then  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  should be smaller than some value  $x_{\mathrm{end}}^{\max}$  given by

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {\max } = \frac {1}{\alpha} - \sqrt {2 + 4 \left(N _ {\text {e n d}} - N _ {\text {i n i}}\right)}, \tag {6.227}
$$

in the  $x < 1 / \alpha$  branch. Equivalently, taking the minus sign in this expression would lead to  $x_{\mathrm{end}}^{\mathrm{min}}$  for the branch  $x > 1 / \alpha$ .

Finally, the observable field value  $x_{*}$  is obtained by solving Eq. (3.48) while the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies fixes the parameter  $M$  to

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 2 8 8 0 \pi^ {2} \alpha^ {2} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.228}
$$

Interestingly enough, it only depends on  $\alpha$ , and not on  $x_{*}$  (i.e. it has no explicit dependence on the reheating). The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the CSI models are represented in Figs. 221 and 222 for  $\alpha = 10^{-3}$  and  $\alpha = 1$ , respectively.
