# Constant  $n_{\mathrm{S}}$  B Inflation (CNBI)

This model is another representative of the class of scenarios studied in Ref. [507]. As was already discussed in section 5.20, it is designed such that the corresponding power spectrum has a constant spectral index. The potential is given by

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ \left(3 - \alpha^ {2}\right) \tan^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) - 3 \right], \tag {5.308}
$$

where  $\alpha$  is a positive dimensionless parameter [507]. Since the potential is periodic with period  $\pi \sqrt{2} / \alpha$  and, moreover, invariant under  $\phi \rightarrow -\phi$ , one can restrict ourselves to the range  $0 < \phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} < \pi / (\sqrt{2}\alpha)$  without loss of generality. The potential is an increasing function of the field and, as a consequence, inflation proceeds from the right to the left. Finally,  $V(\phi)$  is positive provided  $\phi > \phi_0$ , where

$$
\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} = \frac {\sqrt {2}}{\alpha} \arctan \left(\sqrt {\frac {3}{3 - \alpha^ {2}}}\right). \tag {5.309}
$$

Obviously, in order for the potential not to be negative everywhere, one needs to impose that  $\alpha < \sqrt{3}$  and, as a result, the previous expression is well defined. The potential (and its logarithm) is displayed in Fig. 38, in the relevant range  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} < \phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}} < \pi /\left(\sqrt{2}\alpha\right)$ .

Then, defining  $x = \phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  , the slow-roll parameters are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {4 \alpha^ {2} (\alpha^ {2} - 3) ^ {2} \tan^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x\right)}{\left[ \alpha^ {2} + (6 - \alpha^ {2}) \cos (\sqrt {2} \alpha x) \right] ^ {2}}, \tag {5.310}
$$

$$
\epsilon_ {2} = \frac {\alpha^ {2} (3 - \alpha^ {2}) [ 6 + \alpha^ {2} + 2 (6 - \alpha^ {2}) \cos (\sqrt {2} \alpha x) + (\alpha^ {2} - 6) \cos (2 \sqrt {2} \alpha x) ]}{2 \cos^ {6} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x\right) [ 3 + (\alpha^ {2} - 3) \tan^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha x}{\sqrt {2}}\right) ] ^ {2}}, \tag {5.311}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \epsilon_ {3} = 2 \alpha^ {2} (\alpha^ {2} - 3) \tan^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x\right) \left[ 6 (- 7 2 + 1 4 \alpha^ {2} - \alpha^ {4}) + (\alpha^ {2} - 6) (7 \alpha^ {2} + 7 8) \cos (\sqrt {2} \alpha x) \right. \\ \left. - 2 \left(\alpha^ {4} - 1 8 \alpha^ {2} + 7 2\right) \cos \left(2 \sqrt {2} \alpha x\right) + \left(\alpha^ {2} - 6\right) ^ {2} \cos \left(3 \sqrt {2} \alpha x\right) \right] \\ \times \left[ \alpha^ {2} + (6 - \alpha^ {2}) \cos (\sqrt {2} \alpha x) \right] ^ {- 2} \left[ 6 + \alpha^ {2} + 2 (6 - \alpha^ {2}) \cos (\sqrt {2} \alpha x) \right. \\ \left. + \left(\alpha^ {2} - 6\right) \cos (2 \sqrt {2} \alpha x) \right] ^ {- 1}. \tag {5.312} \\ \end{array}
$$

These slow-roll parameters are displayed in Fig. 38 (bottom panels). The first slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{1}$  first decreases as the field  $v\varepsilon v$  increases and reaches a minimum value at  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}$  where  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes and then increases. The value of  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}$  is given by

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} = \frac {1}{\alpha \sqrt {2}} \arccos \left[ \frac {\alpha^ {2} - 6 + \sqrt {\alpha^ {4} - 3 6 \alpha^ {2} + 1 8 0}}{2 (\alpha^ {2} - 6)} \right]. \tag {5.313}
$$

The second slow-roll parameter,  $\epsilon_{2}$ , always decreases as inflation proceeds, crossing  $\epsilon_{2} = 0$  at  $x_{\epsilon_{2} = 0}$ . The third slow-roll parameter,  $\epsilon_{3}$ , is positive for  $x < x_{\epsilon_{2} = 0}$ . In this domain, it

decreases to reach a minimum and then increases and diverges when  $x$  approaches  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}$ . On the contrary, for  $x > x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}$ ,  $\epsilon_3$  becomes negative. It first increases and reaches a local maximum, then decreases and goes to  $-\infty$  at  $x = \pi / (\sqrt{2}\alpha)$ . The three slow roll parameters diverge when  $\phi$  goes to  $\phi_0$  and to  $M_{\mathrm{P1}}\pi / (\sqrt{2}\alpha)$ .

The minimum value of  $\epsilon_{1}$  at  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}$  turns out to be smaller than 1 only if  $\alpha < \alpha_{\mathrm{max}} \simeq 0.2975$ . A (rather long) analytic expression for  $\alpha_{\mathrm{max}}$  can be derived, but it does not provide much information to the present discussion. Therefore, one must require  $\alpha < 0.2975$  in order to realize slow-roll inflation in this model. Then, assuming this is the case, it is clear from Fig. 38 and from the previous considerations that inflation ends by slow-roll violation. If we define  $y \equiv \sin^2 (\alpha x / \sqrt{2})$ , then the condition  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$  is equivalent to  $4(6 - \alpha^{2})^{2}y^{3} - 4(12 - \alpha^{2})(6 - \alpha^{2})y^{2} + 4(45 + 3\alpha^{2} - 6\alpha^{4} + \alpha^{6})y - 36 = 0$ . The relevant solution is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} y _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = \frac {1 2 - \alpha^ {2}}{3 (6 - \alpha^ {2})} + \frac {4}{3} 2 ^ {- 2 / 3} \left(1 - i \sqrt {3}\right) \frac {(3 \alpha^ {2} - 1) (1 8 - 9 \alpha^ {2} + \alpha^ {4}) ^ {2}}{(6 - \alpha^ {2}) ^ {2}} P ^ {- 1 / 3} \\ - \left(1 + i \sqrt {3}\right) \frac {2 ^ {- 1 / 3}}{2 4 (6 - \alpha^ {2}) ^ {2}} P ^ {1 / 3}, \tag {5.314} \\ \end{array}
$$

where we have defined the quantity  $P$  by

$$
\begin{array}{l} P \equiv 6 4 \left(- 6 + \alpha^ {2}\right) ^ {3} \left(- 3 + \alpha^ {2}\right) ^ {2} \left(- 6 + 1 1 0 \alpha^ {2} - 9 \alpha^ {4} + 3 \alpha \sqrt {3} \right. \\ \times \sqrt {- 3 6 + 4 0 8 \alpha^ {2} - 1 2 \alpha^ {4} - 2 5 \alpha^ {6} + 4 \alpha^ {8}}). \tag {5.315} \\ \end{array}
$$

If  $\alpha \ll 1$ , then  $y_{\mathrm{end}} \simeq 1/2$  and  $x_{\mathrm{end}} \simeq \sqrt{2}/\alpha \arcsin(1/\sqrt{2}) = \pi/(2\sqrt{2}\alpha)$ .

As for the CNAI model, the spectral index  $n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 = -2\epsilon_1 - \epsilon_2$ , at first order in slow-roll, can be made constant in some limit. Expanding the slow-roll parameters in  $\alpha$ , while assuming  $\alpha x$  to be small, gives  $\epsilon_1 = x^2\alpha^4 /2 + \mathcal{O}\big(\alpha^6\big)$  and  $\epsilon_{2} = 2\alpha^{2} + \mathcal{O}\big(\alpha^{4}\big)$ , so that  $n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 = -2\alpha^{2} + \mathcal{O}\big(\alpha^{4}\big)$ . Therefore, approximate scale-invariance,  $|n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1|\ll 1$ , implies  $\alpha$  small.

Let us now turn to the slow-roll trajectory. This one can be integrated exactly, leading to the following formula

$$
\begin{array}{l} N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {2} (3 - \alpha^ {2})} \left\{3 \ln \left[ \sin \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x\right) \right] - \frac {6 - \alpha^ {2}}{2} \sin^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x\right) \right. \\ - 3 \ln \left[ \sin \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x _ {\text {e n d}}\right) \right] + \frac {6 - \alpha^ {2}}{2} \sin^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x _ {\text {e n d}}\right) \}. \tag {5.316} \\ \end{array}
$$

This formula can be inverted and  $x$  can be expressed explicitly in terms of the  $e$ -folds number. One obtains

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = \frac {\sqrt {2}}{\alpha} \arcsin \left[ - \frac {3}{6 - \alpha^ {2}} \mathrm {W} _ {- 1} \left(- \frac {6 - \alpha^ {2}}{3} \exp \left\{\frac {2}{3} \alpha^ {2} \left(3 - \alpha^ {2}\right) (N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}}) \right. \right. \right. \\ \left. + 2 \ln \left[ \sin \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x _ {\text {e n d}}\right)\right] - \frac {6 - \alpha^ {2}}{3} \sin^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x _ {\text {e n d}}\right)\right\}\left. \right) \Bigg ] ^ {1 / 2}, \tag {5.317} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\mathrm{W}_{-1}$  is the -1 branch of the Lambert function. It is displayed in Fig. 39. When  $x = \pi / (\sqrt{2}\alpha)$ , the argument of the Lambert function is  $\left(\alpha^2 - 6\right)\exp \left(\alpha^2 / 3 - 2\right) / 3$  which is always larger than  $-1 / e$  for any value of  $\alpha$  (this expression decreases with  $\alpha$  when  $\alpha < \sqrt{3}$ ),

whereas when  $x = \phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the argument of the Lambert function is just given by  $-1 / e$ . For  $x > \phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the value taken by the Lambert function must be less than  $-1$  which indicates that the  $-1$  branch is the relevant one. Therefore, inflation proceeds in the domain displayed in Fig. 39 in which one easily checks that the above trajectory is always well defined.

The slow-roll predictions of the CNBI models are displayed in Fig. 154 for the range  $10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 10^{-1.3}$ . For very small values of  $\alpha$ , the predictions are in agreement with the data with a value of  $n_{\mathrm{S}}$  centered around the constant value  $n_{\mathrm{S}} \simeq 0.97$  and an amount of gravitational waves such that  $r \gtrsim 0.07$ . But one also notices that the spectral index is not really constant. In fact, it does not come as a surprise that the same phenomenon highlighted in section 5.20 is at work here. Indeed, using the slow-roll trajectory (5.316), one has

$$
\sin^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha x _ {*}}{\sqrt {2}}\right) = - \frac {3}{6 - \alpha^ {2}} \mathrm {W} _ {- 1} \left(- \frac {6 - \alpha^ {2}}{3} e ^ {- 2 A / 3}\right), \tag {5.318}
$$

where  $A$  is given by the following expression

$$
A \equiv \alpha^ {2} \left(3 - \alpha^ {2}\right) \Delta N _ {*} - 3 \ln \left[ \sin \left(\frac {\alpha x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{\sqrt {2}}\right) \right] + \frac {6 - \alpha^ {2}}{2} \sin^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{\sqrt {2}}\right). \tag {5.319}
$$

Using the formula for  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  derived above, one obtains, in the limit  $\alpha \ll 1$  and at this order of approximation that  $x_{*} \simeq x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . Therefore, as in section 5.20,  $\alpha x_{*}$  is not a small quantity and one cannot always Taylor expand the trigonometric functions that appear in the expressions of the slow-roll parameters. This explains why, in the limit  $\alpha \ll 1$ , the spectral index is in fact not constant (see section 5.20).

Finally, the CMB normalization gives

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = \frac {1 1 5 2 0 \pi^ {2} \alpha^ {2} \left(3 - \alpha^ {2}\right) ^ {2} \sin^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x _ {*}\right)}{\left[ (\alpha^ {2} - 6) \cos (\sqrt {2} \alpha x _ {*}) - \alpha^ {2} \right] ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.320}
$$

In the limit  $\alpha \ll 1$  we are interested in (since we have seen that, if  $\alpha$  is not small, then the model is ruled out), the above expression takes the form  $M / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 0.02\alpha^{-1/4}(\Delta N_{*})^{-3/8}$ . We obtain almost exactly the same result as for CNAI, see Eq. (5.306), except that the power of  $\alpha$  is different. Taking the value  $\Delta N_{*} = 55$ , it follows that  $M / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 0.0044\alpha^{-1/4}$  and requiring  $M < M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , one obtains the following lower bound,  $\alpha \gtrsim 3.8 \times 10^{-10}$ .
