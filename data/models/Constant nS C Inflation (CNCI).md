# Constant  $n_{\mathrm{S}}$  C Inflation (CNCI)

This model has been obtained in Ref. [507] and is the third example of a class of scenarios already studied in sections 5.20 and 5.21. As explained in those sections, the corresponding potential is designed in order to produce a power spectrum with constant spectral index. The potential studied in this section reads

$$
V \left(\phi\right) = M ^ {4} \left[ \left(3 + \alpha^ {2}\right) \coth^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) - 3 \right], (6. 2 5 4)
$$

where  $\alpha$  is a positive dimensionless parameter (denoted  $n_0$  in Ref. [507]). The potential being symmetrical in  $\phi \rightarrow -\phi$ , only the  $\phi > 0$  part is displayed in Fig. 77. It is a decreasing function of the field  $v ev$ , and its asymptotic value when  $\phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  goes to infinity is given by  $\alpha^2 M^4$ , hence the potential is always positive.

Defining  $x = \phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  , the three first slow-roll parameters are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {4 \alpha^ {2} (3 + \alpha^ {2}) ^ {2} \coth^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha x}{\sqrt {2}}\right)}{\left[ 6 + \alpha^ {2} + \alpha^ {2} \cosh (\sqrt {2} \alpha x) \right] ^ {2}}, \tag {6.255}
$$

$$
\epsilon_ {2} = - \frac {2 \alpha^ {2} (3 + \alpha^ {2}) [ 1 2 + \alpha^ {2} + 2 \alpha^ {2} \cosh (\sqrt {2} \alpha x) + \alpha^ {2} \cosh (2 \sqrt {2} \alpha x) ]}{[ 6 + \alpha^ {2} + \alpha^ {2} \cosh (\sqrt {2} \alpha x) ] ^ {2} \sinh^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha x}{\sqrt {2}}\right)}, \tag {6.256}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \epsilon_ {3} = - 2 \alpha^ {2} (3 + \alpha^ {2}) [ 6 (2 4 - 2 \alpha^ {2} + \alpha^ {4}) + (1 2 0 \alpha^ {2} + 7 \alpha^ {4}) \cosh (\sqrt {2} \alpha x) \\ \left. + 2 \alpha^ {2} \left(\alpha^ {2} - 6\right) \cosh \left(2 \sqrt {2} \alpha x\right) + \alpha^ {4} \cosh \left(3 \sqrt {2} \alpha x\right) \right] \coth^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x\right) \\ \times \left[ 6 + \alpha^ {2} + \alpha^ {2} \cosh (\sqrt {2} \alpha x) \right] ^ {- 2} \left[ 1 2 + \alpha^ {2} + 2 \alpha^ {2} \cosh (\sqrt {2} \alpha x) + \alpha^ {2} \cosh (2 \sqrt {2} \alpha x) \right] ^ {- 1}. \tag {6.257} \\ \end{array}
$$

These slow-roll parameters are displayed in Fig. 77 (bottom panels). We see that the first slow-roll parameters monotonically decreases during inflation. It blows up as the field  $vev$  approaches zero and tends to zero when the field  $vev$  goes to infinity. On the contrary, the second and third slow-roll parameters monotonically increase from  $-\infty$  to zero as inflation proceeds.

Given the above described behavior of  $\epsilon_{1}$ , it is clear that inflation cannot stop by slow-roll violation. Therefore, it should be stopped by instability which means that an extra parameter  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  should be added to the model.

As for CNAI and CNBI, the spectral index  $n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 = -2\epsilon_{1} - \epsilon_{2}$  at first order in slow-roll, can be made constant in some limit. Expanding the slow-roll parameters  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$  in  $\alpha$ , assuming that  $x\alpha$  remains small, one obtains  $\epsilon_{1} = 2 / x^{2} + 2\alpha^{2} / 3 + \mathcal{O}\big(\alpha^{4}\big)$  and  $\epsilon_{2} = -4 / x^{2} + 2\alpha^{2} / 3 + \mathcal{O}\big(\alpha^{4}\big)$ , so that  $n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 = -2\alpha^{2} + \mathcal{O}\big(\alpha^{4}\big)$ . As for the similar calculations performed in sections 5.20 and 5.21, one should remark that, if  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  is such that  $\alpha x_{*} \gtrsim 1$ , the previous expansion can be inaccurate and some deviations from constant  $n_{\mathrm{S}}$  may appear.

Let us now consider the slow-roll trajectory. It can be integrated analytically and is given by the following formula

$$
\begin{array}{l} N - N _ {\text {e n d}} = \frac {1}{\alpha^ {2} (3 + \alpha^ {2})} \left\{3 \ln \left[ \cosh \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x\right) \right] + \frac {\alpha^ {2}}{2} \cosh^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x\right) \right. \tag {6.258} \\ \left. - 3 \ln \left[ \cosh \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}\right) \right] - \frac {\alpha^ {2}}{2} \cosh^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}\right) \right\}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Moreover, this expression can be explicitly inverted. As a consequence, the function  $x(N)$  can be written as

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = \frac {\sqrt {2}}{\alpha} \operatorname {a r c c o s h} \left[ \frac {3}{\alpha^ {2}} \mathrm {W} _ {0} \left(\frac {\alpha^ {2}}{3} \exp \left\{\frac {2}{3} \alpha^ {2} (3 + \alpha^ {2}) (N - N _ {\text {e n d}}) \right. \right. \right. \tag {6.259} \\ \left. + 2 \ln \left[ \cosh \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x _ {\text {e n d}}\right)\right] + \frac {\alpha^ {2}}{3} \cosh^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x _ {\text {e n d}}\right)\right\}\left. \right) \Bigg ] ^ {1 / 2}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\mathrm{W_0}$  is the Lambert function. The fact that we deal with the 0-branch is obvious since the argument of this function is positive definite.

The predictions of the CNCI models are displayed in Fig. 225, for  $\alpha = 10^{-3}$ , 0.1 and 0.2. The thin black solid lines are the lines such that  $n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 = -2\alpha^{2}$ . We see that, for very small values of  $\alpha$ , the predictions are indeed such that the spectral index is constant. For  $\alpha$  not too small, however, we also notice deviations from this law and the larger  $\alpha$  the stronger these

deviations. This is reminiscent with the phenomenon observed in sections 5.20 and 5.21 but now  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  is a free parameter and, for a given value of  $\alpha$ , the deviations from  $n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 = -2\alpha^{2}$  become larger when  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  increase (i.e. when the line becomes redder in Fig. 225). In this case, the Taylor expansion of the trigonometric functions which appear in the expressions of the slow-roll parameters is no longer valid because a larger  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  implies a larger  $x_{*}$ . This has for consequence that CNCI inflation is only marginally consistent with the data. Indeed, it is precisely in the region where  $n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 = -2\alpha^{2}$  would be compatible with the observations that the deviations play an important role and push the predictions away from the allowed contours. In fact, these properties can be better illustrated by deriving explicitly  $x_{*}$ . Using Eq. (6.258), one gets

$$
\cosh^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha x _ {*}}{\sqrt {2}}\right) = \frac {3}{\alpha^ {2}} \mathrm {W} _ {0} \left(\frac {\alpha^ {2}}{3} e ^ {2 A / 3}\right), \tag {6.260}
$$

where we have defined the quantity  $A$  by

$$
A \equiv - \alpha^ {2} \left(3 + \alpha^ {2}\right) \Delta N _ {*} + 3 \ln \left[ \cosh \left(\frac {\alpha x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{\sqrt {2}}\right) \right] + \frac {\alpha^ {2}}{2} \cosh^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{\sqrt {2}}\right). (6. 2 6 1)
$$

In the regime where both  $\alpha \ll 1$  and  $\alpha x_{\mathrm{end}} \ll 1$ , the previous expression reduces to  $x_{*}^{2} \simeq x_{\mathrm{end}}^{2} - 4\Delta N_{*}$ . This last formula is identical to the slow-roll trajectory for LFI provided  $p = -2$ , see Eq. (5.36). At the beginning of this section, we have show that, at leading order  $\epsilon_{1} \simeq 2 / x^{2}$  and  $\epsilon_{2} \simeq -4 / x^{2}$  and, comparing with Eqs. (5.35), we notice that these are also the slow-roll parameters for LFI with  $p = -2$ . In fact, expanding Eq. (6.254), one sees that  $V(\phi) \propto \phi^{-2}$  which confirms the previous considerations. In the regime where  $\alpha \ll 1$  and  $\alpha x_{\mathrm{end}} \ll 1$ , the model is very close to LFI with  $p = -2$ . On the contrary, if  $\alpha x_{\mathrm{end}}$  is not small, then the above relation does not hold anymore and one does not recover a constant spectral index.

Finally, we conclude this section by discussing how the mass scale  $M$  can be chosen. The CMB normalization gives

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = \frac {1 1 5 2 0 \pi^ {2} \alpha^ {2} \left(3 + \alpha^ {2}\right) ^ {2} \cosh^ {2} \left(\frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2}} x _ {*}\right)}{\left[ 6 + \alpha^ {2} + \alpha^ {2} \cosh (\sqrt {2} \alpha x _ {*}) \right] ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.262}
$$

From Eq. (6.260), one deduces that  $\cosh^2 (\alpha x_* / \sqrt{2})\simeq 1 - 2\alpha^2\Delta N_+ + \alpha^2 x_{\mathrm{end}}^2 /2\simeq 1$ . Inserting this formula into Eq. (6.262), and taking the leading order in  $\alpha$ , one obtains  $M / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\simeq 0.02\sqrt{\alpha}$ . This implies that  $M < M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  if  $\alpha \lesssim 2420$ , which is largely the case for the predictions displayed in Fig. 225.
