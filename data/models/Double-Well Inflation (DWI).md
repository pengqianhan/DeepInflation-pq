# Double-Well Inflation (DWI)

In this section, we study the famous "Mexican hat" potential given by

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} - 1 \right] ^ {2}. \tag {5.203}
$$

Except for the mass  $M$  determined by the CMB normalization, it depends on one parameter, the  $vev\phi_0$ . Historically, this potential was first introduced by Goldstone in Ref. [447] as a toy model for dynamical symmetry breaking. In cosmology, it is of course utilized to investigate the formation and the microscopic structure of topological defects [448-454]. In the context

of inflation, it was first used to construct scenarios of topological inflation [455, 456]. In this case, it is made use of the fact that the discrete  $\mathbb{Z}_2$  symmetry,  $\phi \rightarrow -\phi$ , makes the state  $\phi = 0$  unstable. Therefore, the Universe will split into two different regions separated by a domain wall. One can then show that inflation takes place within this topological defect. More precisely, the potential is usually written as  $V = \lambda / 4 (\phi^2 - \eta^2)^2$  where  $\eta$  represents the position of the minima of the potential. Then, Refs. [455, 456] show that topological inflation occurs if  $\eta > M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ . On the other hand, if one writes Eq. (5.203) as  $V = M^4 / \phi_0^4 (\phi^2 - \phi_0^2)^2$ , one sees that one can identify  $\eta$  with  $\phi_0$ . And we will precisely show that agreement with the CMB observations requires  $\phi_0 > M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ . The potential (5.203) was also used in Refs. [457, 458] in the context of open inflation. In a rather different theoretical framework, Eq. (5.203) was studied in Refs. [459, 460] where it was derived in  $N = 1$  supergravity coupled to matter. It is also interesting to notice that it was obtained using various stringy constructions as early as the 80's, see Refs. [461, 462]. More recently, this potential was found to be relevant in a large number of different physical situations [409, 463-473]. The same potential was also obtained in the context of M-flatation, see Refs. [224-226]. Let us finally mention that this model is sometimes viewed as a realistic version of Small Field Inflation (SFI) with  $p = 2$  (see section 6.1), the extra quartic term preventing the potential from becoming negative. However, as will be shown in the following, these two classes of models should actually be described separately since their predictions differ in the relevant range of parameters.

The parameter  $\phi_0$  sets the typical  $vev$  at which inflation proceeds and depends on the symmetry breaking scale one considers. In principle, it could vary over a wide range of values, from  $\phi_0 \sim 10^{15} \mathrm{GeV}$  for GUT symmetry breaking schemes to super-Planckian  $vev$  in a stringy or supergravity context. As will be shown in the following, it is in fact constrained to be large (super-Planckian) in order for the predictions of the model to be compatible with the CMB data. The DWI potential is displayed in Fig. 27 together with its logarithm. One has represented the region  $\phi > 0$  only because the potential is symmetric under  $\phi \rightarrow -\phi$ . We see that it decreases for  $\phi < \phi_0$ , vanishes at  $\phi_0$  and then increases for  $\phi > \phi_0$ . As was already mentioned before, this potential is used to describe dynamical symmetry breaking and, as a consequence, inflation should proceed from the left to the right at  $\phi < \phi_0$ , in the direction specified by the arrow in Fig. 27.

Let us now calculate the slow-roll parameters. If one defines  $x \equiv \phi / \phi_0$  they are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {8 x ^ {2}}{(x ^ {2} - 1) ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {8 (1 + x ^ {2})}{(x ^ {2} - 1) ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {3} = \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {8 \left(x ^ {4} + 3 x ^ {2}\right)}{\left(x ^ {2} - 1\right) ^ {2} \left(x ^ {2} + 1\right)}. \tag {5.204}
$$

The behavior of these parameters is represented in Fig. 27. The first slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{1}$  is an increasing function of  $\phi$  in the range  $x\in [0,1]$ . It vanishes at  $x = 0$  and blows up at  $x = 1$ . Then, for  $x > 1$ , it becomes a decreasing function going to zero when  $x$  goes to infinity. We see in Fig. 27 that inflation stops by violation of the slow-roll conditions. The slow-roll parameters  $\epsilon_{2}$  and  $\epsilon_{3}$  have similar behaviors, except that  $\epsilon_{2}$  does not vanish when  $x = 0$  but is equal to  $\epsilon_{2}(x = 0) = 8(M_{\mathrm{Pl}} / \phi_{0})^{2}$ . Therefore, in order for slow-roll to be valid, this last value should be less than one, which amounts to

$$
\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} > 2 \sqrt {2}. \tag {5.205}
$$

This constraint on the parameter  $\phi_0$  shows that the symmetry breaking scale needs to be super-Planckian. If this last condition is verified, then  $\epsilon_{2}$  becomes greater than one during

inflation at  $\phi_{\epsilon_2 = 1}$  defined by

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 1} = \sqrt {1 + 4 \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \left[ 1 - \sqrt {1 + \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2}} \right]}. \tag {5.206}
$$

This happens before the end of inflation ( $\epsilon_{1} = 1$ ) which occurs at the following value of the field

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} = \sqrt {2 + \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2}} - \sqrt {2}. \tag {5.207}
$$

Let us now turn to the slow-roll trajectory. It can be integrated exactly and yields the following formula

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = \frac {1}{4} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2} \left[ \ln \left(\frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{x}\right) - \frac {1}{2} \left(x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} - x ^ {2}\right) \right], (5. 2 0 8)
$$

where  $N_{\mathrm{end}}$  is the number of  $e$ -folds at the end of inflation. Using the 0-branch of the Lambert function  $\mathrm{W}_0$ , this trajectory can be inverted. One obtains

$$
x = \sqrt {- \mathrm {W} _ {0} \left[ - x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2} e ^ {- x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2}} e ^ {8 \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} (N - N _ {\text {e n d}})} \right]}. \tag {5.209}
$$

The fact that the 0-branch of the Lambert function should be chosen comes from the requirement that  $x < 1$ . The corresponding "trajectory" along the Lambert curve is displayed

in Fig. 28, the arrow indicating in which direction inflation proceeds. This trajectory is remarkably similar to the one of SFI with  $p = 2$ , see section 6.1 and Eq. (6.6), the only difference being that the factor 8 in front of  $N - N_{\mathrm{end}}$  is just 4 in the case of SFI. Therefore not only these two potentials coincide at small fields, but they also give rise to the same kind of slow-roll trajectory. This is why these two models are sometimes identified, DWI being considered as a realistic realization of SFI. However, as shown below, the observations favors super-Planckian values of  $\phi_0$  and, in this limit, the two models are not equivalent (of course, this also has something to do with the debate about whether having super-Planckian  $vev$  is meaningful or not). In fact, in the regime  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \gg 1$ , one can write

$$
x _ {*} \simeq 1 - \sqrt {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}} \sqrt {1 + 2 \Delta N _ {*}} + \frac {1}{3} \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \left(1 + 2 \Delta N _ {*} + \frac {2}{\sqrt {1 + 2 \Delta N _ {*}}}\right) + \ldots . (5. 2 1 0)
$$

From this expression it is clear that, for super-Planckian values of  $\phi_0$ ,  $\phi_*$  is close to the minimum of the potential where the quartic term plays an important role and, consequently, where the SFI potential is not a good approximation. A calculation of the Hubble flow parameters at Hubble crossing confirms this conclusion. They are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \simeq \frac {1}{1 + 2 \Delta N _ {*}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2 *} \simeq \frac {2}{1 + 2 \Delta N _ {*}}, \quad \epsilon_ {3 *} \simeq \frac {2}{1 + 2 \Delta N _ {*}}. \tag {5.211}
$$

This allows us to establish the corresponding expressions of the tensor to scalar ratio, spectral index and running. One obtains

$$
r \simeq \frac {1 6}{1 + 2 \Delta N _ {*}}, \qquad n _ {\mathrm {S}} - 1 \simeq - \frac {4}{1 + 2 \Delta N _ {*}}, \qquad \alpha_ {\mathrm {S}} \simeq - \frac {8}{1 + 2 \Delta N _ {*}}. \qquad (5. 2 1 2)
$$

These expressions should be compared with Eqs. (6.17). We see that the first Hubble flow parameter for SFI and DWI differ by a factor close to 4 and that the  $\epsilon_{2}$  roughly differ by a factor of 2. As a consequence, as can be checked in Fig. 147, the DWI predictions are such that  $\epsilon_{2*} = 2\epsilon_{1*}$  [or equivalently,  $r = 4(1 - n_{\mathrm{S}})$ ], whereas, as can be checked in Fig. 169, we have  $\epsilon_{2*} = 4\epsilon_{1*}$  for SFI [or equivalently,  $r = 8/3(1 - n_{\mathrm{S}})$ ]. This explains why the two models can in fact lead to quite different predictions and why DWI cannot be simply viewed as a mere realistic continuation of SFI.

Finally, it is also interesting to constrain the energy scale  $M$ . For this purpose, we use the CMB normalization which gives

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} = 1 1 5 2 0 \pi^ {2} \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {x _ {*} ^ {2}}{\left(x _ {*} ^ {2} - 1\right) ^ {4}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s} - \mathrm {P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.213}
$$

Then, using the approximated trajectory  $x_{*} \simeq 1 - \sqrt{2 + 4\Delta N_{*}} M_{\mathrm{Pl}} / \phi_{0}$  in the above formula, one obtains the following expression

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} \simeq 1 4 4 0 \pi^ {2} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {1}{(1 + 2 \Delta N _ {*}) ^ {2}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.214}
$$

Then, requiring that  $M < M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  leads to the following upper bound on the value of  $\phi_0$ ,  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^5$ . Combined with the lower limit of Eq. (5.205), we see that the possible range of variation of  $\phi_0$  is quite large.

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the DWI models are displayed in Fig. 147. The reheating equation of state parameter  $\overline{w}_{\mathrm{reh}}$  has been chosen to be 0 since

the potential is quadratic close to its minimum  $V(\phi) \simeq 4M^4 / \phi_0^2 (\phi - \phi_0)^2$ . As claimed before, one can check that only super-Planckian values of the symmetry breaking scale  $\phi_0$  are compatible with the data. Actually, this is also true for the SFI models, see section 6.1 and Fig. 169. As already mentioned before, in this regime, the two models differ while, as expected, they are very similar for sub-Planckian values of the field  $vev$ .
