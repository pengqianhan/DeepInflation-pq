# Generalized Double Well Inflation (GDWI)

These models are a generalization of Double Well Inflation (DWI) discussed in section 5.14 and are of the "Mexican-hat" type. The potential is given by

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2 p} - 1 \right] ^ {2}, \tag {6.442}
$$

where  $\phi_0$  is a vev and  $p > 1$  is the power index. The case  $p = 1$  corresponds to DWI, which is presented in section 5.14. There, it is shown that DWI has different observable predictions than the quadratic Small Field Inflation (SFI) model of section 6.1 and, as such, cannot be simply viewed as a large-field regularization of the SFI potential. This is due to the fact that both DWI and quadratic SFI support slow-roll inflation only for  $\phi_0 > M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  for which they significantly differ. Indeed, at the top of the potential, the second Hubble-flow function for these two models is given by  $\epsilon_2 = 8M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 /\phi_0^2$  and it would exceed unity for  $\phi_0 < M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ . Such a feature comes from the fact that a quadratic term in the potential implies a non-vanishing effective mass at the top of the potential.

For  $p > 1$  the effective mass term vanishes and GDWI can support slow-roll inflation for both  $\phi_0 < M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  and  $\phi_0 \geq M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ . As such, for sub-Planckian  $\phi_0$ , GDWI with  $p > 1$  can

be considered as a UV completion of the SFI models with the same power index  $p$  (see section 6.1). In particular, the case  $p = 2$  has been numerically studied in Ref. [9] and shown to smoothly regularize the quartic SFI model while reducing some of its fine-tuning issues at very small  $vev\phi_0 \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ .

The potential of GDWI, and its logarithm, have been represented in Fig. 95 as a function of  $\phi / \phi_0$ . The negative domain is not represented as the potential is symmetric under the mapping  $\phi \rightarrow -\phi$ . Moreover, we consider only the inflationary domain  $\phi < \phi_0$ . The potential can also inflate at large field values but, in this region, it behaves exactly as Large Field Inflation (LFI) with a power index of  $4p$  (see section 5.2).

Defining the dimensionless field value

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}, \tag {6.443}
$$

the Hubble-flow functions, in the slow-roll approximation, reduce to

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = 8 p ^ {2} \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {x ^ {2 (2 p - 1)}}{\left(x ^ {2 p} - 1\right) ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = 8 p \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {x ^ {2 p} \left(x ^ {2 p} + 2 p - 1\right)}{x ^ {2} \left(x ^ {2 p} - 1\right) ^ {2}}, \tag {6.444}
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_ {3} = 8 p \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {x ^ {2 p} \left[ x ^ {4 p} + (2 p - 1) (p + 2) x ^ {2 p} + 2 p ^ {2} - 3 p + 1 \right]}{x ^ {2} (x ^ {2 p} - 1) ^ {2} (x ^ {2 p} + 2 p - 1)}. \tag {6.445}
$$

They have been represented in the lower panels of Fig. 95, and, as can be seen in these plots, inflation proceeds at the top of the hill towards increasing field values. It gracefully ends when  $\epsilon_{1}(x_{\mathrm{end}}) = 1$  and, from Eq. (6.444),  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  is the solution of

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2 p} - 2 \sqrt {2} p \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}} x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2 p - 1} = 1, \tag {6.446}
$$

in the small field domain  $0 < x < 1$ . This equation cannot be solved analytically for arbitrary values of  $p$  and, in general,  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  has to be determined numerically.

The slow-roll trajectory can, however, be determined by quadrature from Eq. (3.11) and reads

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{8 p (p - 1) M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left[ x ^ {2} \left(p - 1 + x ^ {- 2 p}\right) - x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} \left(p - 1 + x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {- 2 p}\right) \right]. \qquad (6. 4 4 7)
$$

Combined with the reheating equation (3.48), and the numerical solution of Eq. (6.446), one can numerically determine  $x_{*}$ , the field value at which the pivot mode crossed the Hubble radius during inflation.

The mass scale  $M$  of the potential is then given by the CMB normalization and one finds

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 1 1 5 2 0 \pi^ {2} p ^ {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {x _ {*} ^ {2 (2 p - 1)}}{\left(x _ {*} ^ {2 p} - 1\right) ^ {4}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.448}
$$

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for GDWI are represented in Figs. 290 to 292.
