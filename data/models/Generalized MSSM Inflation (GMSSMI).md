# Generalized MSSM Inflation (GMSSMI)

As for the MSSMI models, see section 5.17, GMSSMI scenarios are based on the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM) in which a flat direction is lifted by soft supersymmetry breaking terms and by superpotential corrections. The potential is of the form

$$
V (\phi) = \frac {1}{2} m _ {\phi} ^ {2} \phi^ {2} - A \frac {\lambda_ {n}}{n} \frac {\phi^ {n}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {n - 3}} + \lambda_ {n} ^ {2} \frac {\phi^ {2 (n - 1)}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2 (n - 3)}}. \tag {6.101}
$$

The MSSMI model corresponds to  $n = 6$  and  $A^2 = 8(n - 1)m_{\phi}^2$ . This last relation is of crucial importance since it implies an exactly flat inflection point. Following Refs. [486, 487, 490, 569-572], one may wonder whether the model is robust when this relation is not exactly satisfied. In order to investigate this question, we therefore relax the condition  $A^2 = 8(n - 1)m_{\phi}^2$ . In this more general case, the potential can be reparametrized in the form

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} - \frac {2}{3} \alpha \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {6} + \frac {\alpha}{5} \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {1 0} \right], \tag {6.102}
$$

where  $\phi_0\simeq 10^{14}\mathrm{GeV}$ , this value being the same as the one found in section 5.17. The positive dimensionless parameter  $\alpha$  encodes any deviations from the MSSM case for which it equals unity,  $\alpha_{\mathrm{MSSM}} = 1$ .

The potential is displayed in Fig. 65, where four cases can be distinguished. In the following, we define the quantity  $x$  by the expression

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}. \tag {6.103}
$$

If  $\alpha < 9/25$ , the second derivative of the potential does not vanish and the potential is convex everywhere. This corresponds to the case  $\alpha = 0.1$  case in Fig. 65. If  $9/25 < \alpha < 1$ , the potential has two inflection points  $x_{V''=0}^{\pm}$  and is concave in between. It remains an increasing function of the field since its first derivative never vanishes. This is illustrated with the case  $\alpha = 0.7$  in Fig. 65. If  $\alpha = 1$ , this is the MSSM inflation models (see section 5.17) where the potential has a flat inflection point. If  $1 < \alpha < 9/5$ , the potential decreases in between  $x_{V'=0}^{\pm}$  but remains positive everywhere. This is exemplified by the case  $\alpha = 1.5$  in Fig. 65. Finally, if  $\alpha > 9/5$ , the potential becomes negative (hence is not properly defined) between the two points  $x_{V=0}^{\pm}$  (see  $\alpha = 2.5$  in Fig. 65). The values of the field  $vev$ 's appearing in this

discussion are given by the following formulas:

$$
x _ {V ^ {\prime \prime} = 0} ^ {\pm} = \left[ \frac {5}{9} \left(1 \pm \sqrt {1 - \frac {9}{2 5 \alpha}}\right) \right] ^ {1 / 4}, x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {\pm} = \left(1 \pm \sqrt {1 - \frac {1}{\alpha}}\right) ^ {1 / 4}, (6. 1 0 4)
$$

and

$$
x _ {V = 0} ^ {\pm} = \left[ \frac {5}{3} \left(1 \pm \sqrt {1 - \frac {9}{5 \alpha}}\right) \right] ^ {1 / 4}. \tag {6.105}
$$

Let us now calculate the first three Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation. They are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = 4 5 0 \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {\left(1 - 2 \alpha x ^ {4} + \alpha x ^ {8}\right) ^ {2}}{x ^ {2} \left(1 5 - 1 0 \alpha x ^ {4} + 3 \alpha x ^ {8}\right) ^ {2}}, \tag {6.106}
$$

$$
\epsilon_ {2} = 6 0 \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {1 5 + 4 0 \alpha x ^ {4} + \alpha (2 0 \alpha - 7 8) x ^ {8} + 3 \alpha^ {2} x ^ {1 6}}{x ^ {2} (1 5 - 1 0 \alpha x ^ {4} + 3 \alpha x ^ {8}) ^ {2}},
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \epsilon_ {3} = 6 0 \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} [ 2 2 5 - 1 8 0 0 \alpha x ^ {4} + 6 0 \alpha (6 9 + 1 0 \alpha) x ^ {8} - 4 0 (1 8 9 - 1 0 0 \alpha) \alpha^ {2} x ^ {1 2} \\ + 1 0 \alpha^ {2} (2 4 3 - 5 0 4 \alpha + 4 0 2 \alpha^ {2}) x ^ {1 6} + 4 0 \alpha^ {3} (1 1 7 - 2 0 \alpha) x ^ {2 0} + 1 2 \alpha^ {3} (1 0 \alpha - 1 2 3) x ^ {2 4} \\ + 7 2 \alpha^ {4} x ^ {2 8} + 9 \alpha^ {4} x ^ {3} 2 ] \times [ 3 3 7 5 x ^ {2} + 4 5 0 0 \alpha x ^ {6} - 6 0 0 \alpha (2 7 + 1 0 \alpha) x ^ {1 0} \tag {6.107} \\ + 1 0 0 \alpha^ {2} (2 6 1 - 2 0 \alpha) x ^ {1 4} + 1 0 \alpha^ {2} (2 0 0 \alpha^ {2} - 8 4 0 \alpha - 6 2 1) x ^ {1 8} + 6 0 \alpha^ {3} (6 9 - 2 0 \alpha) x ^ {2 2} \\ \left. + 4 8 \alpha^ {3} (1 0 \alpha - 9) x ^ {2 6} - 1 8 0 \alpha^ {4} x ^ {3 0} + 2 7 \alpha^ {4} x ^ {3 4} \right] ^ {- 1}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The first two slow-roll parameters diverge when  $x \to 0$  and vanish asymptotically. In between, their shape depends on  $\alpha$  as it is represented in Fig. 65. If  $\alpha < 1$ ,  $\epsilon_{1}$  first decreases, reaches a local non-zero minimum where  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes, then increases to reach a local maximum where  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes again, and eventually decreases again. Let  $x_{\epsilon_{2} = 0}^{\pm}$  be the position of these two local extrema. From Ferrari's solutions for depressed quartic equations one gets

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {\pm} = \left[ \frac {1}{2 \alpha} \sqrt {\frac {5}{3}} \left(\sqrt {\Sigma} \pm 2 \sqrt {\frac {3 9}{5} \alpha - 2 \alpha^ {2} - \frac {\Sigma}{4} - \frac {1 2}{\sqrt {1 5 \Sigma}} \alpha^ {2}}\right) \right] ^ {1 / 4}, (6. 1 0 8)
$$

where

$$
\delta = \frac {7 3 6 \alpha^ {2}}{2 5} - \frac {2 0 8 \alpha^ {3}}{1 5} + \frac {1 6 \alpha^ {4}}{9},
$$

$$
\Delta = - \frac {4 3 0 3 3 6 \alpha^ {4}}{6 2 5} + \frac {6 1 2 3 5 2 \alpha^ {5}}{1 1 2 5} - \frac {2 0 9 9 2 \alpha^ {6}}{2 2 5} + \frac {2 5 6 \alpha^ {8}}{2 4 3}, \tag {6.109}
$$

$$
\sigma = - \frac {1 2 8 9 6 \alpha^ {3}}{1 2 5} + \frac {2 9 4 4 \alpha^ {4}}{2 5} - \frac {4 1 6 \alpha^ {5}}{1 5} + \frac {6 4 \alpha^ {6}}{2 7} + \frac {6}{5} \sqrt {1 5 \Delta} \alpha ,
$$

$$
\Sigma = \frac {5 2 \alpha}{5} - \frac {8 \alpha^ {2}}{3} + \frac {\delta}{\sigma^ {1 / 3}} + \sigma^ {1 / 3},
$$

are intermediate quantities introduced solely to reduce the size of Eq. (6.108). If  $\alpha > 1$ ,  $\epsilon_{1}$  has two local minimums located at  $x_{V' = 0}^{\pm}$  where it vanishes. In between it reaches a local

maximum or may even diverges for  $\alpha > 9/5$  (see Fig. 65). The slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes when  $\epsilon_{1}$  reaches these local maxima, or diverge when  $\epsilon_{1}$  does (for  $\alpha > 9/5$ ). As explained in section 5.17, inflation is meant to proceed at  $\phi \lesssim \phi_{0}$ . Let us assume that inflation can end for  $\epsilon_{1} > 1$  between  $x = 0$  and the position of the first minimum  $x_{\epsilon_{1}^{\mathrm{min}}}$ . Following the previous considerations, this latter location is defined as

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {1} ^ {\min }} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {-} & \text {i f} \quad \alpha <   1 \\ x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {-} & \text {i f} \quad \alpha > 1 \end{array} , \right. \tag {6.110}
$$

and provides an upper bound to  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  the solution of  $\epsilon_1(x_{\mathrm{end}}) = 1$ . This one can only be determined numerically. The values of  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^{\pm}$  and  $x_{V' = 0}^{\pm}$  in terms of  $\alpha$  are displayed in the left panel in Fig. 66 together with  $x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{min}}}$ . The right panel of Fig. 66 represents the value of the first slow-roll parameter at this minimum,  $\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{min}} = \epsilon_1(x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{min}}}^{\mathrm{min}})$ . For  $\alpha < 1$ , one can see that  $\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{min}} < 1$  only if the parameter  $\alpha \lesssim 1$ . This defines a minimum value for  $\alpha$ , which depends on  $\phi_0$ , such that inflation can take place within this domain. When  $\alpha \simeq 1$ , one can derive an approximated version of Eq. (6.108), namely,  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^- \simeq 1 - (1 - \alpha) / 32$ . Plugging it into the expression for  $\epsilon_1$  one obtains

$$
\epsilon_ {1} ^ {\min } \simeq \frac {2 2 5}{3 2} (\alpha - 1) ^ {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}, \tag {6.111}
$$

from which one gets

$$
\alpha > 1 - \frac {4 \sqrt {2}}{1 5} \frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}. \tag {6.112}
$$

For the value suggested in Ref. [483],  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-4}$ , one obtains  $\alpha > 1 - 10^{-5}$ , which is in agreement with Ref. [569], and shows that the model needs to be sufficiently fine-tuned (i.e. sufficiently close to regular MSSM inflation) in order to be a viable inflationary model.

On top of that, as shall be seen now, the constraints on  $\alpha$  are even tighter if one wants a sufficient number of  $e$ -folds to be produced. Let us thus turn to the slow-roll trajectory. It

can be integrated, and leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l} N _ {\text {e n d}} - N = \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left\{- \frac {x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2} - x ^ {2}}{2 0} - \frac {b _ {+}}{1 0 \sqrt {a _ {+}}} \left[ \arctan \left(\sqrt {a _ {+}} x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2}\right) - \arctan \left(\sqrt {a _ {+}} x ^ {2}\right) \right] \right. \tag {6.113} \\ \left. - \frac {b _ {-}}{1 0 \sqrt {a _ {-}}} \left[ \arctan \left(\sqrt {a _ {-}} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}\right) - \arctan \left(\sqrt {a _ {-}} x ^ {2}\right) \right] \right\}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where

$$
a _ {\pm} = - \alpha \pm \sqrt {\alpha^ {2} - \alpha}, \quad b _ {\pm} = 2 \frac {a _ {\pm} + \alpha / 3}{a _ {\pm} - a _ {\mp}}, \tag {6.114}
$$

A few remarks are in order. Firstly, even if the terms appearing in the previous expression are complex, their imaginary contributions cancel out and the resulting expression is truly a real quantity. Then, one can check that formally, when  $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ , one has  $a_{\pm} \rightarrow 0$  and  $b_{\pm} \rightarrow 1$ , hence  $N \simeq -\left(x^{2} - x_{\mathrm{ini}}^{2}\right) / 4$ , which is precisely the LFI slow-roll trajectory for  $p = 2$ , see section 5.2. This is just a formal check since  $\alpha$  is meant to be tuned close to 1 in the GMSSMI scenario. Finally, let us notice that, in the case  $\alpha < 1$ , and contrary to the MSSM models ( $\alpha = 1$ ), the number of  $e$ -folds never diverges at a given point  $x$ . Therefore, the total number of  $e$ -folds is bounded from above for the field  $vev$ 's considered here. Working out the limit of Eq. (6.113) when  $\alpha \rightarrow 1$ , one has

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N _ {\mathrm {i n i}} \leq \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {\pi}{3 0} \frac {1}{\sqrt {1 - \alpha}}. \tag {6.115}
$$

If one require at least  $\Delta N = N_{\mathrm{end}} - N_{\mathrm{ini}}$ $e$  -folds during inflation, then  $\alpha$  has to be fine-tuned to

$$
\alpha > 1 - \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} \frac {\pi^ {2}}{9 0 0 \Delta N ^ {2}}. \tag {6.116}
$$

Remembering that the small parameter here is  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , one can see that it is a much tighter constraint than the one of Eq. (6.112). Taking  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-4}$  and  $\Delta N \simeq 50$ , one obtains  $\alpha > 1 - 10^{-22}$ . This is clearly an extreme fine-tuning which can even make the numerical investigation of the model challenging<sup>7</sup>. As explained below, the same condition  $|\alpha - 1| < \phi_0^4 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^4 / \Delta N^2$  also applies to the case  $\alpha > 1$  in order to maintain an acceptable deviation from scale invariance. This makes GMSSM inflation a severely fine-tuned scenario. Let us also notice that our parameter  $\alpha$  is related to the parameter  $\delta$  of Ref. [570] by  $\delta = \sqrt{\alpha^{-2} - 1}$ . Ref. [570] finds that, in order for the model to be compatible with the data,  $\delta \simeq 10^{-20}$ . Therefore, although our method slightly differs from that of Ref. [570], our results are in broad agreement.

Finally, the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies fixes the parameter  $M$  to

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 2 8 8 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {\left(1 - 2 \alpha x _ {*} ^ {4} + \alpha x _ {*} ^ {8}\right) ^ {2}}{x _ {*} ^ {4} \left(1 - \frac {2}{3} \alpha x _ {*} ^ {4} + \frac {\alpha}{5} x _ {*} ^ {8}\right) ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.117}
$$

As explained in section 5.17, this leads to  $M / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{8}$  GeV for  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-4}$ .

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions of the GMSSMI models are displayed in Figs. 191, 193, for  $\alpha > 1$  and  $\alpha < 1$ , respectively. The reheating equation of state parameter  $\overline{w}_{\mathrm{reh}}$  has been taken to 0 since the potential is quadratic close to its minimum. In both

cases, one can see that in the limit  $\alpha \rightarrow 1$ , the standard MSSM predictions are recovered, see Fig. 150. The amount of gravitational waves  $r$  seems to be quite independent on  $\alpha$  and, therefore, is similar to its regular MSSM counterpart. On the other hand, the spectral index  $n_{\mathrm{s}}$  strongly depends on  $\alpha$ . In the case  $\alpha > 1$ , larger values of  $\alpha - 1$  worsens the spectral index problem, already present in standard MSSMI. These models are therefore strongly disfavored by the data. In the case  $\alpha < 1$  however, there is a very narrow range of acceptable values for  $\alpha$ . They are well inside the  $|\alpha - 1| < \phi_0^4 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^4 / \Delta N^2$  condition and the spectral index is inside the two-sigma confidence intervals. But, as can be seen in Fig. 193, the spectral index varies so quickly with  $\alpha$  that one has to fine-tune the power of the fine-tuning to remain inside the two-sigma contours. In Refs. [487, 569-572], it is argued that, since the flat saddle point condition is robust against radiative corrections, such a fine-tuning may not be a problem. However, as explained here and in section 5.17, if the flat saddle point condition is exactly satisfied, the model is disfavored by the observations because the spectral index is too red. The only way out is therefore to detune the condition  $\alpha = 1$  at an extremely fine-tuned level.
