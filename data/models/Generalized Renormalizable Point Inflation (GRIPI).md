# Generalized Renormalizable Point Inflation (GRIPI)

As for the MSSMI models (see section 5.17) and for the RIPI models (see section 5.18), the GRIPI models have a potential of the form

$$
V (\phi) = \frac {1}{2} m _ {\phi} ^ {2} \phi^ {2} - A \frac {\lambda_ {n}}{n} \frac {\phi^ {n}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {n - 3}} + \lambda_ {n} ^ {2} \frac {\phi^ {2 (n - 1)}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2 (n - 3)}}. \tag {6.118}
$$

In section 5.18, the particular example  $n = 3$  is discussed in the case where the potential has a flat inflection point, i.e. when  $A^2 = 16m_\phi^2$ . Then, as studied in section 6.6 for MSSMI, comes the question of what happens when we relax this condition. To address this issue, it is convenient to reparametrize the potential as

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} - \frac {4}{3} \alpha \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {3} + \frac {\alpha}{2} \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {4} \right], \tag {6.119}
$$

where the positive dimensionless parameter  $\alpha$  encodes the deviation from the RIPI case (that is to say  $\alpha_{\mathrm{RIPI}} = 1$ ). This model was studied in Ref. [573] and in Refs. [574, 575]. In the first reference, the mass  $m_{\phi}$  is fixed by the soft supersymmetry breaking terms and, in section 5.18, it was shown that this leads to  $\phi_0\simeq 10^{14}\mathrm{GeV}$ . However, in Refs. [574, 575], the scale  $m_{\phi}$  is no longer controlled by the soft supersymmetry breaking terms but by the right-handed neutrino mass in Type I supersymmetric seesaw and this leads to a different value for  $\phi_0$ , namely  $\phi_0\simeq 10^{17}\mathrm{GeV}$ . Therefore, in what follows, we will use both values.

The potential is displayed in Fig. 67, where four cases can be distinguished. In the following, for convenience, we use the quantity  $x$  defined by

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}. \tag {6.120}
$$

If  $\alpha < 3/4$ , the second derivative of the potential does not vanish and the potential is convex everywhere. This corresponds to the case  $\alpha = 0.7$  case in Fig. 67. If  $3/4 < \alpha < 1$ , the potential has two inflection points  $x_{V''=0}^{\pm}$  and is concave in between. It remains an increasing function of the field since its first derivative never vanishes. This is illustrated by the case  $\alpha = 0.85$  in Fig. 67. If  $\alpha = 1$ , then this is the RIPI model (see section 5.18) where the

potential has a flat inflection point. If  $1 < \alpha < 9/8$ , then the potential decreases between the two values of  $x$ ,  $x_{V' = 0}^{\pm}$ , for which the derivative is zero, but remains positive everywhere. Typically, this corresponds to the case  $\alpha = 1.094$  in Fig. 67. Finally, if  $\alpha > 9/8$ , then the potential becomes negative (hence is not properly defined everywhere) between  $x_{V = 0}^{\pm}$  (see the case  $\alpha = 1.188$  in Fig. 67). The values of the field  $vev$  in this discussion are given by the following formulas:

$$
x _ {V ^ {\prime \prime} = 0} ^ {\pm} = \frac {2}{3} \left(1 \pm \sqrt {1 - \frac {3}{4 \alpha}}\right), \quad x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {\pm} = 1 \pm \sqrt {\frac {\alpha - 1}{\alpha}}, \tag {6.121}
$$

and

$$
x _ {V = 0} ^ {\pm} = \frac {4}{3} \left(1 \pm \sqrt {1 - \frac {9}{8 \alpha}}\right). \tag {6.122}
$$

Let us now calculate the first Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation.

They are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = 7 2 \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {\left(1 - 2 \alpha x + \alpha x ^ {2}\right) ^ {2}}{x ^ {2} (6 - 8 \alpha x + 3 \alpha x ^ {2}) ^ {2}}, \tag {6.123}
$$

$$
\epsilon_ {2} = 2 4 \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {6 - 1 6 \alpha x + (3 + 1 6 \alpha) \alpha x ^ {2} - 1 2 \alpha^ {2} x ^ {3} + 3 \alpha^ {2} x ^ {4}}{x ^ {2} (6 - 8 \alpha x + 3 \alpha x ^ {2}) ^ {2}},
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \epsilon_ {3} = 2 4 \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \left[ 3 6 - 2 1 6 \alpha x + 3 0 \alpha (3 + 1 6 \alpha) x ^ {2} - 8 (4 5 + 6 4 \alpha) \alpha^ {2} x ^ {3} \right. \\ + 2 (2 7 + 2 7 6 \alpha + 1 2 8 \alpha^ {2}) \alpha^ {2} x ^ {4} - 2 (2 0 8 \alpha + 8 1) \alpha^ {3} x ^ {5} + 9 (1 + 2 8 \alpha) \alpha^ {3} x ^ {6} \tag {6.124} \\ - 7 2 \alpha^ {4} x ^ {7} + 9 \alpha^ {4} x ^ {8} ] \times \left[ x ^ {2} (6 - 8 \alpha x + 3 \alpha x ^ {2}) ^ {2} (6 - 1 6 \alpha x + 3 \alpha x ^ {2} + 1 6 \alpha^ {2} x ^ {2} \right. \\ \left. \left. - 1 2 \alpha^ {2} x ^ {3} + 3 \alpha^ {2} x ^ {4}\right) \right] ^ {- 1}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The first two slow-roll parameters diverge when  $x \to 0$  and asymptotically goes to zero when  $x \to \infty$ . In between, their behavior depends on  $\alpha$  as can be seen in Fig. 67. If  $\alpha < \alpha_0$ , where

$$
\alpha_ {0} = \frac {3}{1 6} \left[ 5 - 3 ^ {2 / 3} (6 - 2 \sqrt {3}) ^ {- 1 / 3} - 2 ^ {- 2 / 3} (9 - 3 \sqrt {3}) ^ {1 / 3} \right] \simeq 0. 4 6 7 1, \tag {6.125}
$$

$\epsilon_{1}$  monotonically decreases with  $x$ . If  $\alpha_0 < \alpha < 1$ ,  $\epsilon_{1}$  first decreases, reaches a local nonvanishing minimum at a value of  $x$  for which  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes, then increases to reach a local maximum where  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes again, and eventually decreases for  $x \to \infty$ , as already mentioned. Let  $x_{\epsilon_{2} = 0}^{\pm}$  be the position of these two local extrema. Similarly to Eq. (6.108) for the generalized MSSM inflation models, analytic expressions can be obtained for these two quantities using Ferrari's solutions for depressed quartic equations. They are implemented in ASPIC but are not displayed here since this does not add much to the discussion. If  $\alpha > 1$ ,  $\epsilon_{1}$  has two local minima located at  $x_{V' = 0}^{\pm}$  where it vanishes. In between it reaches a local maximum or may even diverge for  $\alpha > 9/8$  (see Fig. 67). The slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes when  $\epsilon_{1}$  reaches these local maxima, or diverge when  $\epsilon_{1}$  itself diverges (for  $\alpha > 9/8$ ).

As explained in section 5.18, inflation is supposed to proceed at  $\phi \lesssim \phi_0$ . Let us assume that inflation ends by violation of slow-roll between  $x = 0$  and the position of the first minimum  $x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{min}}}$ . Following the previous considerations, this latter value of  $x$  is defined by

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {1} ^ {\min }} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {-} & \text {i f} \quad \alpha_ {0} <   \alpha <   1 \\ x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {-} & \text {i f} \quad \alpha > 1 \end{array} , \right. \tag {6.126}
$$

and, moreover, provides an upper bound to determine  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  [i.e. the solution of the equation  $\epsilon_1(x_{\mathrm{end}}) = 1$ ]. Let us emphasize that this one can only be determined numerically. The values of  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^{\pm}$  and  $x_{V' = 0}^{\pm}$  in terms of  $\alpha$  are displayed in the left panel of Fig. 68 together with  $x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{min}}}$ . The right panel of Fig. 68 represents the value of the first slow-roll parameter at this minimum,  $\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{min}} = \epsilon_1(x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{min}}})$ . For  $\alpha < \alpha_0$ , one has  $\epsilon_1(x = 1) > 1.5M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 / \phi_0^2$  and, recalling that typically  $\phi_0 \simeq 10^{14}\mathrm{GeV}$  or  $\phi_0 \simeq 10^{17}\mathrm{GeV}$ , one sees that inflation cannot proceed in this case. For  $\alpha_0 < \alpha < 1$ , one has  $\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{min}} < 1$  only if the parameter  $\alpha \lesssim 1$ . This defines a minimum value for  $\alpha$ , which depends on  $\phi_0$ , allowing for inflation to take place. When  $\alpha \simeq 1$ , one can

derive an approximated formula for  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^{-}$ , namely,  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^{-} \simeq 1 - (1 - \alpha) / 2$ . Plugging it into the expression for  $\epsilon_1$  one obtains

$$
\epsilon_ {1} ^ {\min } \simeq 7 2 (\alpha - 1) ^ {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}, \tag {6.127}
$$

from which it follows that

$$
\alpha > 1 - \frac {\sqrt {2}}{1 2} \frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}. \tag {6.128}
$$

With  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-1}$ , one obtains  $\alpha > 0.99$ , which shows that the model needs to be sufficiently fine-tuned such that it becomes very similar to the regular RIPI scenario. If, on the other hand,  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-4}$ , the constraint is much tighter. As discussed in Refs. [574, 575], one of the main advantage of the model studied in those references is that a value  $\phi_0 \simeq 10^{17} \mathrm{GeV}$  leads to a less severe fine tuning problem than  $\phi_0 \simeq 10^{14} \mathrm{GeV}$ .

However, the constraints on  $\alpha$  are tighter to get a sufficient number of  $e$ -folds. Let us therefore now turn to the determination of the slow-roll trajectory. It can be integrated exactly to give

$$
\begin{array}{l} N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left\{\frac {5 - 4 \alpha}{1 2 \sqrt {\alpha (1 - \alpha)}} \arctan \left(\frac {x - 1}{\sqrt {1 / \alpha - 1}}\right) + \frac {x}{2} \left(\frac {x}{4} - \frac {1}{3}\right) \right. \\ + \left(\frac {1}{8 \alpha} - \frac {1}{6}\right) \ln [ 1 + \alpha x (x - 2) ] - \frac {5 - 4 \alpha}{1 2 \sqrt {\alpha (1 - \alpha)}} \arctan \left(\frac {x _ {\text {e n d}} - 1}{\sqrt {1 / \alpha - 1}}\right) \tag {6.129} \\ \left. - \frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{2} \left(\frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{4} - \frac {1}{3}\right) - \left(\frac {1}{8 \alpha} - \frac {1}{6}\right) \ln \left[ 1 + \alpha x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} (x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - 2) \right] \right\}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Exactly the same remarks we have made for the GMSSMI model also applies here (see section 6.6). In particular, for  $\alpha < 1$ , and contrary to the RIPI models ( $\alpha = 1$ ), the number of  $e$ -folds never diverges at a given point  $x$ . Therefore, the total number of  $e$ -folds is bounded by some maximal finite value. From Eq. (6.129) when  $\alpha \to 1$ , one has

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N _ {\mathrm {i n i}} \leq \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {\pi}{2 4} \frac {1}{\sqrt {1 - \alpha}}. (6. 1 3 0)
$$

Therefore, if one require at least  $\Delta N = N_{\mathrm{end}} - N_{\mathrm{ini}}$ $e$  -folds, one has to fine-tune  $\alpha$  to

$$
\alpha > 1 - \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} \frac {\pi^ {2}}{5 7 6 \Delta N ^ {2}}. \tag {6.131}
$$

Remembering that the small parameter here is  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , one can see that it is a much tighter constraint than the one of Eq. (6.128). Taking  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-1}$  and  $\Delta N \simeq 50$ , one obtains  $\alpha > 1 - 10^{-10}$ . This makes the fine-tuning quite important and, as explained below, the same condition  $|\alpha - 1| < \phi_0^4 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^4 / \Delta N^2$  also applies to the case  $\alpha > 1$  to maintain an acceptable deviation from scale invariance, making the whole class of models fine-tuned. However, as already mentioned above, the value  $\phi_0 \simeq 10^{17} \mathrm{GeV}$  makes the fine-tuning issue easier to accept than the value  $\phi_0 \simeq 10^{14} \mathrm{GeV}$ .

Finally, the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies fixes the parameter  $M$  to

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 6 2 2 0 8 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {\left(1 - 2 \alpha x _ {*} + \alpha x _ {*} ^ {2}\right) ^ {2}}{x _ {*} ^ {4} \left(6 - 8 \alpha x _ {*} + 3 \alpha x _ {*} ^ {2}\right) ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.132}
$$

As explained in section 5.17, this leads to  $M / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{13} \mathrm{GeV}$  for  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-4}$ .

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions of the GRIPI models are displayed in Figs. 195, 197, for  $\alpha > 1$  and  $\alpha < 1$  respectively, and for values of  $\phi_0$  such that  $\phi_0 \simeq 10^{17} \mathrm{GeV}$ :  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} = 10^{-2}$ ,  $10^{-1.5}$ ,  $10^{-1}$ ,  $10^{-0.5}$ , 1. The reheating equation of state parameter  $\overline{w}_{\mathrm{reh}}$  has been taken to 0 since the potential is quadratic close to its minimum. In both cases, one can see that in the limit  $\alpha \rightarrow 1$ , the standard RIPI predictions are recovered, see Fig. 151. The amount of gravitational waves  $r$  seems to be quite independent on  $\alpha$  while the spectral index  $n_{\mathrm{s}}$  strongly depends on it. In the case  $\alpha > 1$ , the fine-tuning is as important as in the case  $\alpha < 1$  as mentioned above. Considering values of  $\alpha$  very different from 1 worsens the spectral index problem, already present in standard RIPI. These models are therefore strongly disfavored by the data. In the case  $\alpha < 1$  however, there is a very narrow range of acceptable values for  $\alpha$ . They are well inside the  $|\alpha - 1| < \phi_0^4 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^4 / \Delta N^2$  condition and the spectral index is inside the two-sigma confidence intervals. But as can be seen in Fig. 197, the spectral index varies so quickly with  $\alpha$  that, even if the fine-tuning is less problematic than in the GMSSMI case (due to the different value of  $\phi_0$ ), it is still very important.
