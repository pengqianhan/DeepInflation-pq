# Horizon Flow Inflation at first order (HF1I)

The horizon flow models have been introduced in Ref. [391] and consist into designing field potentials to exactly produce a truncated Taylor expansion of the Hubble parameter with respect to the field. As such they constitute a whole class of phenomenological inflationary models. Here, we are considering a potential designed such that  $H(\phi) = H_0(1 + A_1\phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}})$ , where  $A_{1}$  is a free dimensionless parameter. The shape of the potential reads [391]

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left(1 + A _ {1} \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2} \left[ 1 - \frac {2}{3} \left(\frac {A _ {1}}{1 + A _ {1} \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}}\right) ^ {2} \right]. \tag {5.142}
$$

Denoting  $x \equiv \phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the potential admits a global minimum at  $x_{V^{\mathrm{min}}} = -1 / A_1$ , which is negative

$$
V _ {\min } = V \left(\phi_ {V ^ {\min }}\right) = - \frac {2}{3} M ^ {4} A _ {1} ^ {2} <   0. \tag {5.143}
$$

As a result, there are two disconnected field domains in which the potential remains definite positive, either  $x > x_{V=0}^{+}$  or  $x < x_{V=0}^{-}$  where  $x_{V=0}^{\pm}$  are the two roots of  $V(x_{V=0}^{\pm}) = 0$ , i.e.

$$
x _ {V = 0} ^ {+} = \sqrt {\frac {2}{3}} - \frac {1}{A _ {1}}, \quad x _ {V = 0} ^ {-} = - \sqrt {\frac {2}{3}} - \frac {1}{A _ {1}}. \tag {5.144}
$$

An interesting consequence of the horizon flow approach is that the Hubble flow functions can be calculated exactly, i.e. without the slow-roll approximation because  $H(\phi)$  is exactly known. As discussed in Refs. [46, 392], one could compare them with the other hierarchy of parameters,  $\epsilon_i^V$ , that are defined by the successive logarithmic derivatives of the potential. In the slow-roll approximation, one precisely uses the potential derivatives to approximate the Hubble flow functions. From  $H \propto 1 + A_1x$ , one gets the exact Hubble flow functions

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = 2 \left(\frac {A _ {1}}{1 + A _ {1} x}\right) ^ {2}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \epsilon_ {3} = 2 \epsilon_ {1}, \tag {5.145}
$$

whereas the slow-roll functions associated with the potential are

$$
\epsilon_ {1} ^ {V} = \frac {1 8 A _ {1} ^ {2} (A _ {1} x + 1) ^ {2}}{\left[ 3 + 6 A _ {1} x + A ^ {2} (3 x ^ {2} - 2) \right] ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} ^ {V} = \frac {1 2 A _ {1} ^ {2} \left[ 3 + 6 A _ {1} x + A _ {1} ^ {2} (3 x ^ {2} + 2) \right]}{\left[ 3 + 6 A _ {1} x + A _ {1} ^ {2} (3 x ^ {2} - 2) \right] ^ {2}}, \tag {5.146}
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_ {3} ^ {V} = \frac {1 0 8 A _ {1} ^ {2} \left(A _ {1} x + 1\right) ^ {2} \left[ 1 + 2 A _ {1} x + A _ {1} ^ {2} (x ^ {2} + 2) \right]}{\left[ 3 + 6 A _ {1} x + A _ {1} ^ {2} (3 x ^ {2} - 2) \right] ^ {2} \left[ 3 + 6 A _ {1} x + A _ {1} ^ {2} (3 x ^ {2} + 2) \right]}. \tag {5.147}
$$

As shown in Ref. [46], the link between the two hierarchies can be made explicit and one has

$$
\epsilon_ {1} ^ {V} = \epsilon_ {1} \left(\frac {1 - \eta / 3}{1 - \epsilon_ {1} / 3}\right) ^ {2}. \tag {5.148}
$$

The  $\eta$  parameter is defined as

$$
\eta \equiv \frac {2}{H} \frac {\mathrm {d} ^ {2} H}{\mathrm {d} x ^ {2}}, \tag {5.149}
$$

and vanishes in our case. As a result, provided  $\epsilon_1 \ll 1$ , i.e. we are in the slow-roll approximation, both hierarchies give the same results at first order. In order to establish Eq. (5.148), one has to show first that

$$
\eta = \epsilon_ {1} + \frac {1}{\sqrt {2 \epsilon_ {1}}} \frac {\mathrm {d} \epsilon_ {1}}{\mathrm {d} x}, \tag {5.150}
$$

and then that

$$
\frac {\mathrm {d} \epsilon_ {1}}{\mathrm {d} x} = (\epsilon_ {1} - 3) \left(\frac {\mathrm {d} \ln V}{\mathrm {d} x} - \sqrt {2 \epsilon_ {1}}\right). \tag {5.151}
$$

The potential and the exact Hubble flow functions have been represented in Fig. 21.

Inflation can take place inside the two positive definite domains of the potential, i.e. at negative or positive field values. However, the Hubble parameter has to be positive such that  $H_0$  has to be chosen negative if  $1 + A_{1}x < 0$  along the field trajectory. Since the potential is completely symmetric with respect to its minimum  $x_{V^{\mathrm{min}}}$ , we can study in full generality

only the  $x > x_{V = 0}^{+}$  branch. In particular, as the Hubble flow functions are exact, we can also derive the exact field trajectory

$$
N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = - \frac {1}{2 A _ {1}} \left(x + \frac {1}{2} A _ {1} x ^ {2} - x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - \frac {1}{2} A _ {1} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}\right). \tag {5.152}
$$

Let us notice that, in the slow-roll approximation, one would have derived the trajectory from  $\epsilon_1^V$ . Doing so, one would have obtained

$$
N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = - \frac {1}{2 A _ {1}} \left(x + \frac {1}{2} A _ {1} x ^ {2} - x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - \frac {1}{2} A _ {1} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} - \frac {2}{3} A _ {1} \ln \left| \frac {1 + A _ {1} x}{1 + A _ {1} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}} \right|\right). (5. 1 5 3)
$$

It is amusing to remark that here, the simplest formula is not given by the slow-roll derived one, but rather by the exact one. From this remark one should keep in mind that, in order to simplify trajectories integration, one can always add factors of order  $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_1)$ . The exact trajectory (5.152) can be inverted and one finds

$$
x = - \frac {1}{A _ {1}} + \frac {1}{A _ {1}} \sqrt {1 + 2 A _ {1} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} + A _ {1} ^ {2} \left[ x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} - 4 (N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}}) \right]}. \tag {5.154}
$$

Along both the positive and negative branch of the potential, inflation ends naturally at  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$ , that is at

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {1} = 1} ^ {\pm} = \frac {- 1 \pm \sqrt {2} A _ {1}}{A _ {1}}. \tag {5.155}
$$

Along the positive branch we are interested in, we therefore have

$$
x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = x _ {\epsilon_ {1} = 1} ^ {+} = \frac {- 1 + \sqrt {2} A _ {1}}{A _ {1}}. \tag {5.156}
$$

Plugging this expression into Eq. (5.154) gives the field value  $x_{*}$  at which the pivot mode crossed the Hubble radius during inflation in terms of the  $e$ -fold number  $\Delta N_{*} = N_{\mathrm{end}} - N_{*}$ . Let us remember that solving for  $x_{*}$  (or  $\Delta N_{*}$ ) is made through Eq. (3.48). From Eq. (5.145), one gets

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} = \frac {1}{1 + 2 \Delta N _ {*}} \tag {5.157}
$$

which, together with  $\epsilon_{2} = 2\epsilon_{1}$ , yields

$$
n _ {\mathrm {S}} - 1 = 2 n _ {\mathrm {T}}, \quad r = 4 \left(1 - n _ {\mathrm {S}}\right). \tag {5.158}
$$

Notice that this relation is different from the power law case and consistent with Ref. [393]. In that reference, the authors mention that the horizon flow models predicts  $r \simeq 4.8(1 - n_{\mathrm{S}})$  as a result of Monte-Carlo simulations.

Finally, the potential parameter  $M$  can be determined from the CMB normalization

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 9 6 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {A _ {1} ^ {2}}{(1 + A _ {1} x _ {*}) ^ {4}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.159}
$$

It is interesting to notice that the typical energy scale of inflation in these models does not depend on  $A_{1}$ . The previous equation indeed leads to

$$
\frac {V \left(x _ {*}\right)}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} = \frac {4 8 0 \pi^ {2}}{1 + 2 \Delta N _ {*}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s} - \mathrm {P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}} \left(1 - \frac {1}{3 + 6 \Delta N _ {*}}\right) \simeq 1 0 ^ {- 9}. \tag {5.160}
$$

The reheating consistent (exact) predictions for the horizon flow inflation I models are represented in Fig. 137. As expected, the relation  $\epsilon_{2} = 2\epsilon_{1}$ , which is the same as for the LFI quadratic case, is properly recovered. The predictions do not depend much on the potential parameter  $A_{1}$ .
