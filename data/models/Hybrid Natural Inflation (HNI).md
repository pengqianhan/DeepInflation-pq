# Hybrid Natural Inflation (HNI)

# Theoretical Justifications

This scenario is an extension of Natural Inflation (NI, see section 5.6) in which the end of inflation can be triggered by a waterfall mechanism as in Hybrid Inflation (see section 7.2). This idea, as well as explicit supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric two-fields constructions of the model, have been presented in Refs. [333, 703-707]. In addition to stopping inflation, the waterfall field distorts the effective potential along the inflationary direction such that the potential for HNI reads

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ 1 + \alpha \cos \left(\frac {\phi}{f}\right) \right]. (7. 1 4 5)
$$

The typical vacuum expectation value for the inflaton,  $f$ , can be made super-Planckian as HNI describes a multiple-field model (see section 5.6). The parameter  $0 < \alpha < 1$  encodes the distortions induced by the waterfall field onto the inflationary direction, and as can be seen in Fig. 116, this implies that the minimum of the potential is non-vanishing. Note however that the true minimum of the potential in the two-field space is elsewhere, and, exactly as for Hybrid Inflation, the ground state of the waterfall field is expected to cancel this apparent residual cosmological constant. For our purpose, it means that the potential of Eq. (7.145) cannot be trusted for  $\phi / f \simeq \pi$ , and we will only consider the inflationary domain connected to the maximum of the potential at  $\phi = 0$ .

Finally, let us remark that the potential of NI is recovered for  $\alpha \rightarrow 1$  but, even in this limit, both models may have different observable predictions as HNI may end by waterfall instability instead of slow-roll violations. As such, HNI has three parameters,  $\alpha$ ,  $f$  and the field value at which inflation stops,  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ .

# Slow-roll Analysis

Introducing  $x = \phi /f$ , the Hubble-flow functions in the slow-roll approximation are

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {\alpha^ {2} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{2 f ^ {2}} \frac {\sin^ {2} (x)}{\left[ 1 + \alpha \cos (x) \right] ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \frac {2 \alpha M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{f ^ {2}} \frac {\alpha + \cos (x)}{\left[ 1 + \alpha \cos (x) \right] ^ {2}}, \tag {7.146}
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_ {3} = - \frac {\alpha M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{f ^ {2}} \frac {\sin^ {2} (x)}{\left[ 1 + \alpha \cos (x) \right] ^ {2}} \frac {1 - 2 \alpha^ {2} - \alpha \cos (x)}{\alpha + \cos (x)}. \tag {7.147}
$$

They have been represented in the lower panels of Fig. 116 for  $\alpha = 0.5$ . The first Hubble-flow function exhibits a maximum within the inflationary domain, at a field value that is solution of  $\epsilon_{2}(x) = 0$ , and given by

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {1} ^ {\max }} = \operatorname {a r c c o s} (- \alpha). \tag {7.148}
$$

Plugging this value into Eq. (7.146) gives the maximal value reached by  $\epsilon_1(x)$  over the domain  $x\in ]0,\pi [$

$$
\epsilon_ {1} ^ {\max } = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{2 f ^ {2}} \frac {\alpha^ {2}}{1 - \alpha^ {2}}. \tag {7.149}
$$

It is larger than unity if  $\alpha >\alpha_{1}$ , or, equivalently, if  $f < f_{1}$ , where

$$
\alpha_ {1} \equiv \frac {1}{\sqrt {1 + M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} / (2 f ^ {2})}}, \quad f _ {1} \equiv \frac {\alpha}{\sqrt {2 \alpha^ {2} - 2}}. \tag {7.150}
$$

When this happens, the inflationary domain becomes disconnected, and, a priori, one could have inflation close to the top of the potential (around  $\phi = 0$ ), or close to the bottom of the potential at  $\phi / f \lesssim \pi$ . As we have mentioned in the previous section, the latter situation will be discarded as one cannot trust anymore Eq. (7.145) to describe the two-field dynamics (see also the discussion regarding this possibility for VHI in section 7.2). Nonetheless, this creates the possibility that HNI gracefully ends if the field value at which the waterfall instability develops is in the domain for which  $\epsilon_1 > 1$ . This scenario will be referred to as HNI1 and the smallest root of  $\epsilon_1(x) = 1$  gives the field value at which inflation ends in that case,

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {1} = 1} = \operatorname {a r c c o s} \left\{\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\alpha f} \frac {\sqrt {\frac {\alpha^ {2} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{4 f ^ {2}} + \frac {\alpha^ {2} - 1}{2}} - 1}{1 + \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{2 f ^ {2}}} \right\}. \tag {7.151}
$$

This solution exists provided  $\alpha >\alpha_{1}$  (or  $f < f_{1}$ ) and one has  $x_{\mathrm{end}} = x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$ , making HNI1 a two-parameter model.

In the other, and more generic, scenario, referred to as HNI2, inflation will be assumed to always end by instability, for all values of  $\alpha$  and  $f$ . As a result, for  $\alpha > \alpha_{1}$ , there is an upper bound for the field value at which the instability occurs, namely  $x_{\mathrm{end}} < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$ . For  $\alpha < \alpha_{1}$ ,  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  can be taken up to  $x_{\mathrm{end}}^{\max} = \pi$ , the minimum of the potential.

The slow-roll trajectory can be explicitly integrated using Eq. (3.11) and reads

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = \frac {f ^ {2}}{\alpha M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left\{(1 - \alpha) \ln \left[ \frac {\cos \left(\frac {x}{2}\right)}{\cos \left(\frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{2}\right)} \right] - (1 + \alpha) \ln \left[ \frac {\sin \left(\frac {x}{2}\right)}{\sin \left(\frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{2}\right)} \right] \right\}. (7. 1 5 2)
$$

The logarithmic divergence at  $x \to 0$  shows that the number of  $e$ -folds that can be realized around the top of the potential is unbounded, so  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  can be arbitrarily small. From Eq. (7.146), one also sees that although  $\epsilon_1 \to 0$  at the top of the potential, the second slow-roll parameter reaches a constant value

$$
\epsilon_ {2} (x = 0) = \frac {2 \alpha}{1 + \alpha} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{f ^ {2}}. (7. 1 5 3)
$$

As such, for  $\alpha = \mathcal{O}(1)$ , slow roll inflation at the top of the HNI potential can only take place for super-Planckian values of  $f$ , a situation in all points similar to the small-field model SFI2 (see section 6.1). It is however possible to accommodate sub-Planckian values of  $f$  with slow roll but only at the expanse of having  $\alpha \ll 1$ . The scenario HNI2 in the limit  $x_{\mathrm{end}} \ll 1$  is therefore a constant-spectral-index model with vanishing running and highly suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio.

Using the reheating equation (3.48), together with the field value at which inflation ends,  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , Eq. (7.152) uniquely determines  $x_*$ , the field value at which the pivot mode crossed

the Hubble radius during inflation. The mass scale  $M$  of the potential is fixed by the CMB normalization and verifies

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} \alpha^ {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{f ^ {2}} \frac {\sin^ {2} (x _ {*})}{[ 1 + \alpha \cos (x _ {*}) ] ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {7.154}
$$

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the two HNI models (HNI1 and HNI2) are represented in Figs. 457 to 468.
