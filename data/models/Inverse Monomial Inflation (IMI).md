# Inverse Monomial Inflation (IMI)

These models are characterized by the inverse monomial potential given by

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left(\frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {- p}, \tag {6.304}
$$

where  $p$  is a positive number. This scenario has been studied in many different situations: in Refs. [361, 624, 625] it was considered in the context of quintessential inflation, in Refs. [626-629] in the context of tachyon inflation, in Refs. [555, 557] in the context of intermediate inflation and in Ref. [374] in the context of Randall-Sundrum braneworld models. In all these articles, the potential was just postulated. An attempt to derive this potential from high energy considerations was made in Refs. [630, 631] in the context of supersymmetric QCD. Let us, however, notice that this was done in order to build a model of quintessence and not of inflation. The model uses the group  $\mathrm{SU}(N_{\mathrm{c}})$  and has  $N_{\mathrm{f}}$  flavors. The quarks  $Q^i$ ,  $i = 1,\dots ,N_{\mathrm{f}}$  are placed in the fundamental representation of  $\mathrm{SU}(N_{\mathrm{c}})$  and the anti-quarks  $Q_i^\dagger$  in the conjugate representation [630]. At scales below the gauge breaking scale  $\Lambda$ , the relevant degrees of freedom are the pions  $\pi_j^i = Q^i Q_j^\dagger$  and one can show that the corresponding superpotential is given by [632, 633]

$$
W = \left(N _ {\mathrm {c}} - N _ {\mathrm {f}}\right) \frac {\Lambda^ {3 \left(N _ {\mathrm {c}} - N _ {\mathrm {f}}\right) / \left(N _ {\mathrm {c}} - N _ {\mathrm {f}}\right)}}{\left(\det \pi\right) ^ {1 / \left(N _ {\mathrm {c}} - N _ {\mathrm {f}}\right)}}. \tag {6.305}
$$

The potential (6.304) then follows from the F-term associated to the above superpotential.

The potential is represented in Fig. 83 for  $p = 2$ . It is a decreasing function of the field  $vev$  and, hence, inflation proceeds from the left to the right, in the direction specified by the arrow in the figure.

The three Hubble flow functions are straightforwardly obtained from Eqs. (3.4), (3.5) and (3.6). Defining  $x \equiv \phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , one gets

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {p ^ {2}}{2 x ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = - \frac {2 p}{x ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {3} = \epsilon_ {2}. \tag {6.306}
$$

These functions are represented in the two bottom panels in Fig. 83. The first slow-roll parameter is a monotonic decreasing function of  $\phi$  while  $\epsilon_{2}$  and  $\epsilon_{3}$  are negative increasing functions. From these expressions, one can also immediately deduce that, for a given  $p$ , the model in the plane  $(\epsilon_{1},\epsilon_{2})$  is represented by the line  $\epsilon_{1} = -(p / 4)\epsilon_{2}$ . Since inflation proceeds from the left to the right, it cannot stop by slow-roll violation. As a consequence, an extra-mechanism, such as e.g. tachyonic instability, must be implemented to end inflation. Let us denote  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  the position at which such a process occurs. The model has therefore two free parameters:  $p$  and  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ .

The slow-roll trajectory can be obtained by quadrature from Eq. (3.11), and one obtains

$$
N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = \frac {1}{2 p} \left(x ^ {2} - x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}\right). (6. 3 0 7)
$$

This expression can be inverted and reads

$$
x = \sqrt {x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2} + 2 p (N - N _ {\text {e n d}})}. \tag {6.308}
$$

Let us now derive some prior condition on  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . One can notice that when  $x < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1} = p / \sqrt{2}$ , one has  $\epsilon_1 > 1$  and inflation cannot take place. This means that inflation can only

proceed between  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  and  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , where the maximum number of  $e$ -folds is, using Eq. (6.307),  $\Delta N_{\mathrm{max}}(x_{\mathrm{end}}) = \left(x_{\mathrm{end}}^2 - x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^2\right) / (2p)$ . Put it differently, if one wants to realize at least  $\Delta N$ $e$ -folds, then one has to work with  $x_{\mathrm{end}} > x_{\mathrm{end}}^{\mathrm{min}}$  where

$$
x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {\mathrm {m i n}} (\Delta N) = \sqrt {p ^ {2} / 2 + 2 p \Delta N}. (6. 3 0 9)
$$

This defines a prior condition on  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$

Finally, the parameter  $M$  can be determined from the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies, and it follows that

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} p ^ {2} x _ {*} ^ {p - 2} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.310}
$$

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the IMI models are displayed in Fig. 250. For a given value of  $p$ , they lie along the line  $(1 - 2 / p)r = 8(1 - n_{\mathrm{S}})$ , i.e.  $\epsilon_1 = -(p / 4)\epsilon_2$ . As expected, large values of  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , or small values of the reheating temperature (these two parameters being degenerate), are preferred.
