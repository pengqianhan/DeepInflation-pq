# Logamediate Inflation (LMI)

Logamediate inflation has been discussed in Refs. [566, 567] and refers to inflationary scenarios in which the scale factor evolves according to

$$
a (t) = a _ {0} \exp \left[ A \left(\ln \frac {t}{t _ {0}}\right) ^ {\lambda} \right], \tag {6.62}
$$

where  $A$  and  $\lambda$  are two dimensionless parameters and where  $t_0$  has the dimension of a cosmic time. This evolution form for the scale factor is required to occur "at late times", i.e. when  $t \gg t_0$ . If  $\lambda = 1$ , one recovers the power law model (see section 5.8), and in that case,  $t_0$  can be absorbed in a rescaling of the scale factor. Otherwise, these three parameters are relevant and one therefore expects LMI to be a two parameters models according to our classification. Following Ref. [566], from Eq. (6.62), one has

$$
H \equiv \frac {\dot {a}}{a} = \frac {A \lambda}{t} \left(\ln \frac {t}{t _ {0}}\right) ^ {\lambda - 1}, \tag {6.63}
$$

from which one deduces that  $A\lambda > 0$  in order to have expansion  $(H > 0)$ . From Eq. (6.62), one can also establish that

$$
\frac {\ddot {a}}{a} = \frac {A \lambda}{t ^ {2}} \left(\ln \frac {t}{t _ {0}}\right) ^ {\lambda - 1} \left[ (\lambda - 1) \left(\ln \frac {t}{t _ {0}}\right) ^ {- 1} - 1 + A \lambda \left(\ln \frac {t}{t _ {0}}\right) ^ {\lambda - 1} \right], (6. 6 4)
$$

from which one deduces that in order to have inflation at late times (when  $t \gg t_0$ ), one must have  $\lambda > 1$ , or if  $\lambda = 1$ ,  $A > 1$ . If this inflationary scenario is implemented within a single minimally coupled scalar field  $\phi$ , one can derive the corresponding potential. From the Friedmann-Lemaître and Klein-Gordon equations one can show that [566]

$$
\frac {\dot {\phi} (t)}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} = \frac {\sqrt {2 A \lambda}}{t} \left(\ln \frac {t}{t _ {0}}\right) ^ {\frac {\lambda - 1}{2}}. \tag {6.65}
$$

This equation can easily be integrated into

$$
\frac {\phi (t)}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} = \frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} + 2 \frac {\sqrt {2 A \lambda}}{\lambda + 1} \left(\ln \frac {t}{t _ {0}}\right) ^ {\frac {\lambda + 1}{2}}. \tag {6.66}
$$

Combining the Friedmann-Lemaître equation  $3M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{2}H^{2} = V(\phi) + \dot{\phi}^{2} / 2$  and the relation  $2M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{2}\dot{H} = -\dot{\phi}^{2}$ , one obtains  $V(\phi) = 3M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{2}H^{2} + M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{2}\dot{H}$ , namely

$$
V (\phi) = \frac {3 M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} A ^ {2} \lambda^ {2}}{t ^ {2}} \left(\ln \frac {t}{t _ {0}}\right) ^ {2 (\lambda - 1)} + \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} A \lambda}{t ^ {2}} (\lambda - 1) \left(\ln \frac {t}{t _ {0}}\right) ^ {\lambda - 2} - \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} A \lambda}{t ^ {2}} \left(\ln \frac {t}{t _ {0}}\right) ^ {\lambda - 1}. (6. 6 7)
$$

Together with Eq. (6.66), this gives a parametric representation of the field potential in terms of  $t$ . It can be further simplified since the Logamediate regime occurs in the limit  $t \gg t_0$ . If  $\lambda > 1$ , the first term of this expression dominates at late times and one has  $V(\phi) = 3M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 A^2\lambda^2 (\ln t / t_0)^{2(\lambda - 1)} / t^2$ . Defining  $x \equiv (\phi - \phi_0) / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , one makes use of Eq. (6.66) to obtain

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} x ^ {\alpha} \exp \left(- \beta x ^ {\gamma}\right), \tag {6.68}
$$

where the new parameters are defined by

$$
\alpha = 4 \frac {\lambda - 1}{\lambda + 1}, \quad \beta = 2 \left(\frac {\lambda + 1}{2 \sqrt {2 A \lambda}}\right) ^ {2 / (\lambda + 1)}, \quad \gamma = \frac {2}{\lambda + 1}, \tag {6.69}
$$

and

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} = \frac {3 A ^ {2} \lambda^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} t _ {0} ^ {2}} \left(\frac {\lambda + 1}{2 \sqrt {2 A \lambda}}\right) ^ {4 \frac {\lambda - 1}{\lambda + 1}}. \tag {6.70}
$$

The same potential has been studied for  $\alpha = 2$ ,  $\beta = 1/8$  and  $\gamma = 2$  within tachyon inflation models in Ref. [513]. The case  $\lambda = 1$  is particular. At late times, the first term and the last term must be kept in Eq. (6.67), such that  $V(\phi) = (3A - 1)AM_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 /t^2$ . In that situation, one has  $x = \sqrt{2A}\ln t / t_0$ , and the derived potential shares the same expressions for  $\alpha$ ,  $\beta$  and  $\gamma$  as in Eq. (6.69) but evaluated at  $\lambda = 1$ . There is a difference however because  $M^4$  now reads  $M^4 = (3A - 1)AM_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 /t_0^2$ . We recover explicitly that  $\lambda = 1$  corresponds to power law inflation and has already been treated in section 5.8.

In the following, we will work only with the derived parameters  $\beta$ ,  $\gamma$  and  $M^4$ , noticing that

$$
\alpha = 4 (1 - \gamma). \tag {6.71}
$$

The restrictions  $A\lambda > 0$  and  $\lambda \geq 1$  translates into the conditions  $0 < \gamma \leq 1$  and  $\beta > 0$ . Following Ref. [567], since there is no fundamental reasons preventing it, we will generalize this model to any possible values of these parameters supporting inflation.

The three first Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation read

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {\left(\alpha - \beta \gamma x ^ {\gamma}\right) ^ {2}}{2 x ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \frac {2}{x ^ {2}} \left[ \alpha + \beta (\gamma - 1) \gamma x ^ {\gamma} \right], \tag {6.72}
$$

$$
\epsilon_ {3} = \frac {\alpha - \beta \gamma x ^ {\gamma}}{x ^ {2}} \frac {2 \alpha - \beta (\gamma - 2) (\gamma - 1) \gamma x ^ {\gamma}}{\alpha + \beta (\gamma - 1) \gamma x ^ {\gamma}}. \tag {6.73}
$$

The potential and the Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation have been represented in Fig. 62.

Inflation can proceed in two regimes: either at decreasing field values, left to the top of the potential (LMI1), or at increasing field values, right to the top of the potential (LMI2). Notice that from Eq. (6.66),  $\phi$  has to increase with time to reproduce the scale factor expansion Eq. (6.62) and this happens only in the regime LMI2 for large values of  $x$ . As can be seen in Fig. 62, the slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{1}$  diverges when  $x$  approaches zero, it vanishes at the top of the potential for  $x = x_{V^{\max}}$  and it is maximal at  $x = x_{\epsilon_1^{\max}}$  with

$$
x _ {V ^ {\max }} \equiv \left(\frac {\alpha}{\beta \gamma}\right) ^ {1 / \gamma}, \quad x _ {\epsilon_ {1} ^ {\max }} = \left[ \frac {\alpha}{\beta \gamma (1 - \gamma)} \right] ^ {1 / \gamma}. \tag {6.74}
$$

Finally it asymptotes to zero for large values of the field. The value of the local maximum of  $\epsilon_{1}$  reads

$$
\epsilon_ {1} ^ {\max } = \frac {\alpha^ {2}}{2} \left[ \frac {\beta \gamma (1 - \gamma)}{\alpha} \right] ^ {\frac {2}{\gamma}} \left(\frac {\gamma}{1 - \gamma}\right) ^ {2}. \tag {6.75}
$$

Thus in the regime LMI1, inflation always stops naturally as  $\epsilon_{1}$  becomes larger than unity whereas in the regime LMI2, this may occur only if  $\epsilon_{1}^{\max} > 1$  and if inflation has started from  $x_{\mathrm{ini}} < x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}}}$ . Otherwise, if inflation starts with  $x_{\mathrm{ini}} > x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}}}$ , or if  $\epsilon_{1}^{\mathrm{max}} < 1$ , one needs

to add an extra-parameter  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  encoding an unspecified mechanism to end inflation. In that situation, the model becomes a three parameters one. If one makes use of  $\alpha = 4(1 - \gamma)$ , one obtains  $\epsilon_1^{\max} = 8\gamma^2 (\beta \gamma /4)^{2 / \gamma}$ . Solving  $\epsilon_1^{\max}\geq 1$  for  $\beta$  gives

$$
\beta \geq \frac {4}{\gamma (8 \gamma^ {2}) ^ {\gamma / 2}}. \tag {6.76}
$$

This condition is therefore required for the model LMI2, if one wants inflation to end naturally. As we will see below, LMI2 inflating in the domain  $x_{V^{\max}} < x < x_{\epsilon_1^{\max}}$  is a very fine-tuned situation which is strongly disfavored by the observations. Notice that if one assumes  $0 < \gamma \leq 1$ , this conditions translates into  $\beta > \sqrt{2}$ .

Finally, let us notice that for the value of  $\epsilon_{2}$  at the top of the potential to be smaller than some maximal value  $\epsilon_{2,\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{max}}$ , one needs to impose the condition

$$
\beta <   \beta^ {\max } (\gamma , \epsilon_ {2, \text {t o p}} ^ {\max }) = 2 ^ {2 - 3 \gamma / 2} (\epsilon_ {2, \text {t o p}} ^ {\max }) ^ {\gamma / 2} \frac {(1 - \gamma) ^ {1 - \gamma / 2}}{\gamma^ {1 + \gamma / 2}}. \tag {6.77}
$$

In the LMI1 model, a slow roll regime of inflation can proceed only if such a condition is verified (with typically  $\epsilon_{2,\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{max}}\simeq 10^{-1}$ ).

The slow-roll trajectory can be integrated thanks to the hypergeometric function [281, 282]  ${}_{2}{F}_{1}$  ,leading to

$$
N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = \frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}}{2 \alpha} _ {2} F _ {1} \left[ 1, \frac {2}{\gamma}, \frac {2}{\gamma} + 1, \left(\frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{x _ {V ^ {\max}}}\right) ^ {\gamma} \right] - \frac {x ^ {2}}{2 \alpha} _ {2} F _ {1} \left[ 1, \frac {2}{\gamma}, \frac {2}{\gamma} + 1, \left(\frac {x}{x _ {V ^ {\max}}}\right) ^ {\gamma} \right]. (6. 7 8)
$$

One can notice that inserting  $\alpha = 4(1 - \gamma)$ , as a function of  $x / x_{V^{\mathrm{max}}}$ , this trajectory only involves  $\gamma$ . Plugging  $x = x_{V^{\mathrm{max}}}$  into Eq. (6.78) one gets an infinite number of  $e$ -folds. This means that the required number of  $e$ -folds to solve the problems of the standard Big-Bang scenario can always be realized, both in the decreasing branch of the potential and the increasing one, provided that inflation starts close enough to  $x_{V^{\mathrm{max}}}$ . However, it can numerically be checked that in the case of LMI2 with  $\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}} > 1$  and inside the  $x_{V^{\mathrm{max}}} < x < x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}}}^{\mathrm{max}}$  region, one has to fine-tune  $x_{\mathrm{ini}}$  and  $x_*$  extremely close to  $x_{V^{\mathrm{max}}}$ . In that situation  $n_{\mathrm{S}} = 1$ , with vanishing  $r$  and vanishing running of the spectral index, can be considered as generic predictions of the model. For this reason, it is more natural to consider LMI2 in the large field regime, namely  $x > \max(x_{V^{\mathrm{max}}}, x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}}})$ , together with the extra-parameter  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ .

The trajectory in Eq. (6.78) cannot be inverted analytically. However, one can perform some consistency checks in the limit  $x / x_{V^{\max}} \gg 1$  in which

$$
N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} \simeq \frac {1}{\beta \gamma (2 - \gamma)} \left(x ^ {2 - \gamma} - x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2 - \gamma}\right), \tag {6.79}
$$

and

$$
x \simeq \left[ x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2 - \gamma} + \beta \gamma (2 - \gamma) (N - N _ {\text {e n d}}) \right] ^ {\frac {1}{2 - \gamma}}. \tag {6.80}
$$

These expressions can be compared to Eq. (6.66)

$$
x = 2 \frac {\sqrt {2 A \lambda}}{\lambda + 1} \left(\ln \frac {t}{t _ {0}}\right) ^ {\frac {\lambda + 1}{2}}, \tag {6.81}
$$

where  $t$  in terms of the number of  $e$ -folds  $N$  can be obtained from Eq. (6.62). With  $N - N_0 = A(\ln t / t_0)^\lambda$ , one gets

$$
x = 2 \frac {\sqrt {2 A \lambda}}{\lambda + 1} \left(\frac {N - N _ {0}}{A}\right) ^ {\frac {\lambda + 1}{2 \lambda}}. \tag {6.82}
$$

The previous calculations are consistent since, making use of Eq. (6.69), Eq. (6.80) and Eq. (6.82) are the same when setting the constants  $N_0 = N_{\mathrm{ini}}$  and  $x_0 = x_{\mathrm{ini}} = 0$ . This means that in the late times limit  $x / x_{V^{\max}} \gg 1$ , the slow-roll trajectory coincides with the exact one, as expected.

The amplitude of the CMB anisotropies fixes the value of the parameter  $M$  according to

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} (\alpha - \beta \gamma x _ {*} ^ {\gamma}) ^ {2} e ^ {\beta x _ {*} ^ {\gamma}} x _ {*} ^ {- \alpha - 2} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s} - \mathrm {P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}, \tag {6.83}
$$

where  $x_{*}$  is the observable field value obtained by solving Eq. (3.48) given some assumptions on the reheating. The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the models LMI1 and LMI2 (at  $x > x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}}}$ ) are displayed in Figs. 176, 177, and 178 for LMI1, and in Figs. 179, 182, and 185 for LMI2. In the case of LMI2, the turning points in the plots precisely correspond to the case where inflation occurs in the fine-tuned domain  $x_{V^{\mathrm{max}}} < x_{*} < x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}}}$  and in which the model behaves like a pure de Sitter era.
