# Loop Inflation (LI)

# Theoretical Justifications

The flatness of an inflationary potential is in general altered by radiative corrections. One loop order corrections generically take the form of a logarithmic function,  $\ln (\phi /\mu)$ , where  $\mu$  is a renormalization scale. Starting from a perfectly flat potential, one obtains a potential of the form  $V(\phi) = M^4\left[1 + \alpha \ln \left(\phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\right)\right]$  where  $\alpha$  is a dimensionless parameter that tunes the strength of the radiative effects. Studying such potentials is therefore a simple way to

discuss in which cases the quantum correction "spoil" the flatness of a potential, and how this happens.

In fact, this type of scenarios were invented in the context of  $F$  and  $D$ -term inflation in Refs. [414-417]. The original motivation was to build an inflationary model in supersymmetry but without the  $\eta$ -problem that appears in the  $F$ -term approach. Indeed, if one considers a simple superpotential  $W = f / 2X\phi^2 - \mu^2 X$  where  $\phi$  and  $X$  are two superfields, then it is easy to obtain the supersymmetric potential assuming a minimal Kähler potential:  $V = |f\phi^2 / 2 - \mu^2|^2 + f^2|X|^2|\phi|^2$ . There is a flat direction for  $\phi = 0$  along the  $X$  direction with  $V = \mu^4$ . Lifting this direction with a one loop correction leads to the LI potential which is suitable for inflation. However, considering non-minimal terms in the Kähler potential destroys the flatness of  $V$ . The  $D$ -term approach was shown to be a viable alternative. The idea is to consider a theory with a U(1) symmetry and three chiral superfields,  $X$ ,  $\phi_{+}$  and  $\phi_{-}$  with charges 0, +1 and -1 respectively. It then follows that the superpotential has the form  $W = \lambda X\phi_{+}\phi_{-}$ . If we compute the corresponding potential in global supersymmetry, one arrives at

$$
V = \lambda^ {2} | X | ^ {2} \left(| \phi_ {-} | ^ {2} + | \phi_ {+} | ^ {2}\right) + \lambda^ {2} | \phi_ {+} \phi_ {-} | ^ {2} + \frac {g ^ {2}}{2} \left(| \phi_ {+} | ^ {2} - | \phi_ {-} | ^ {2} + \xi\right) ^ {2}, \tag {5.174}
$$

where the part proportional to  $g$  ( $g$  being the gauge coupling) represents the  $D$ -part of  $V$ . In this expression  $\xi$  is a Fayet-Iliopoulos term. There is a unique supersymmetric vacuum at  $X = \phi_{+} = 0$  and  $|\phi_{-}| = \sqrt{\xi}$  and a flat direction along the  $X$  direction with  $\phi_{+} = \phi_{-} = 0$  where the potential  $V = g^{2}\xi^{2} / 2$  can drive inflation. Since supersymmetry is broken along the flat direction, this produces one loop corrections and we obtain

$$
V = \frac {g ^ {2}}{2} \xi^ {2} \left[ 1 + \frac {g ^ {2}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} \ln \left(\frac {\lambda^ {2} | X | ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}}\right) \right], (5. 1 7 5)
$$

where  $\mu$  is a renormalization scale. We see that this potential has exactly the form of an LI potential where the scale  $M$  is related to the Fayet-Iliopoulos term  $\xi$  and where  $\alpha$  is in fact the square of the gauge coupling. In particular, this implies that  $\alpha > 0$  in this context. One can also reproduce the above calculation in supergravity (with minimal Kähler potentials) and show that the  $D$ -part of the theory leads to the same potential which is free of the  $\eta$  problem.

After these initial works on  $D$ -term inflation, many other papers addressing different issues were published. Observational constraints on this type of scenarios were discussed in Refs. [418, 419]. Ref. [420] has discussed how to produce  $D$ -term inflation and to stabilize the moduli at the same time. Then, in Refs. [421-423], it was shown that the stringy implementation of  $D$ -term inflation is problematic. We have seen that the scale  $M$  is essentially controlled by the value of the Fayet-Iliopoulos term  $\xi$ . Therefore, the CMB normalization allows us to calculate the value of  $\xi$ . Anticipating the calculation at the end of this section, if one uses the equation after Eq. (5.187) with  $M^4 = g^2\xi^2 /2$  and  $\alpha = g^{2} / (8\pi^{2})$  [from Eq. (5.175)], then one arrives at

$$
\xi \simeq \left[ \left(\frac {9 0}{\Delta N _ {*}}\right) ^ {1 / 4} \left(\frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}}}{T}\right) ^ {1 / 2} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} \right] ^ {2} \simeq \left(6. 9 \times 1 0 ^ {1 5} \mathrm {G e V}\right) ^ {2}, \tag {5.176}
$$

where we have taken the fiducial value  $\Delta N_{*} \simeq 50$ . As noticed in Refs. [421-423], in string theory, one typically obtains  $\xi = (\mathrm{Tr}Q)M_{\mathrm{s}}^{2} / (192\pi^{2})$  where  $M_{\mathrm{s}}$  is the string scale and  $\mathrm{Tr}Q \simeq 100$  sums the U(1) charges of all massless states. This leads to  $\xi \simeq (\mathrm{few} \times 10^{17}\mathrm{GeV})^2$  and, therefore, does not match the CMB normalization (5.176). Then, Refs. [424, 425] studied more complicated models in the supersymmetric context in order to fix the problem we have just discussed. Other scenarios were also investigated in Refs. [426-429].  $D$ -term inflation in the context of string theory and brane inflation was also discussed in Ref. [309, 430-435]. The same topic was also addressed in Refs. [436, 437] but in the context where the Friedmann equations receive quadratic corrections. Finally, Ref. [438] studied LI potentials in the case of Wess-Zumino models. Let us emphasize again that, in all these models, the constant  $\alpha$  is positive and given in terms of the square of a gauge coupling.

The LI potential was also derived in a different framework in Ref. [439]. This article uses the O'Raifeartaigh-Witten model that will be studied in more detail in section 5.23. Therefore, we do not give the details here and only quote results that will be reviewed in that section. In particular, we will see in Eq. (5.338) that the only difference is that the parameter  $\alpha$  is now given in terms of three coupling constants and has a rather involved form which allows for negative  $\alpha$  values. For this reason we will not fix the sign of  $\alpha$  in the following.

# Slow-Roll Analysis

Let us now turn to the slow-roll study of loop inflation. We recall that the potential takes the following form

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ 1 + \alpha \ln \left(\frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) \right], \tag {5.177}
$$

where  $\alpha$  is a dimensionless parameter, that can a priori be either positive or negative (see the above discussion). Let us define the quantity  $x \equiv \phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ . The potential Eq. (5.177), as well as its logarithm, is displayed in Fig. 24. If  $\alpha > 0$ , it is an increasing function of the field  $v_{ev}$ , and vanishes at

$$
x _ {V = 0} = e ^ {- 1 / \alpha}. \tag {5.178}
$$

Hence inflation proceeds from the right to the left at  $x > x_{V=0}$  in that case. If  $\alpha < 0$  however, the potential is a decreasing function of the field, which vanishes at  $x_{V=0}$ , still given by Eq. (5.178), hence inflation proceeds from the left to the right at  $x < x_{V=0}$ .

The three first Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {\alpha^ {2}}{2} \frac {1}{x ^ {2}} (1 + \alpha \ln x) ^ {- 2}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = 2 \alpha \frac {1}{x ^ {2}} \frac {1 + \alpha + \alpha \ln x}{(1 + \alpha \ln x) ^ {2}}, \tag {5.179}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \epsilon_ {3} = 2 \alpha \frac {1}{r ^ {2}} (1 + \alpha \ln x) ^ {- 2} (1 + \alpha + \alpha \ln x) ^ {- 1} \times \\ \left[ 1 + \frac {3 \alpha}{2} + \alpha^ {2} + \left(2 \alpha + \frac {3}{2} \alpha^ {2}\right) \ln x + \alpha^ {2} \ln^ {2} x \right]. \tag {5.180} \\ \end{array}
$$

If  $\alpha > 0$ , the first slow-roll parameter is a decreasing function of the field  $vev$ , which diverges at  $x_{V=0}$  and vanishes when  $x \to \infty$ . Therefore inflation stops by slow-roll violation, at the point  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  satisfying  $\epsilon_1 = 1$  and given by

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}} \left[ \mathrm {W} _ {0} \left(\frac {e ^ {1 / \alpha}}{\sqrt {2}}\right) \right] ^ {- 1}, \tag {5.181}
$$

where  $\mathrm{W_0}$  is the 0-branch of the Lambert function. One can check that since  $\mathrm{W_0}(y) < y$  for any  $y$ , one always has  $x_{\mathrm{end}} > x_{V = 0}$ , as required. When  $\alpha \ll 1$ , one has  $x_{\mathrm{end}} \simeq \alpha /\sqrt{2}$ . If  $\alpha < 0$  on the other hand, the first slow-roll parameter diverges at  $x = 0$ , decreases with  $x$ , reaches a minimum at  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0} = \exp (-1 - 1 / \alpha)$ , then increases with  $x$  and diverges at  $x_{V = 0}$ . The minimum value of  $\epsilon_1$  equals  $\epsilon_1(x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}) = \exp (2 + 2 / \alpha) / 2$  which is smaller than unity only if  $\alpha >2 / (\ln 2 - 2)\simeq -1.53$ . Otherwise  $\epsilon_1(x) > 1$  all over the domain and inflation cannot take place. If  $\alpha >2 / (\ln 2 - 2)$ , the inflationary domain lies between  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^-$  and  $x_{\mathrm{end}} = x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^+$ , with

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {1} = 1} ^ {-} = - \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}} \left[ \mathrm {W} _ {- 1} \left(\frac {- e ^ {1 / \alpha}}{\sqrt {2}}\right) \right] ^ {- 1}, \quad x _ {\text {e n d}} = x _ {\epsilon_ {1} = 1} ^ {+} = - \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}} \left[ \mathrm {W} _ {0} \left(\frac {- e ^ {1 / \alpha}}{\sqrt {2}}\right) \right] ^ {- 1}, \tag {5.182}
$$

and where  $W_{-1}$  is the  $-1$ -branch of the Lambert function. When  $|\alpha| \ll 1$ , one has  $x_{\mathrm{end}} \simeq e^{-1 / \alpha} - 1 / \sqrt{2} \gg 1$ . Let us notice that the end of inflation occurs in the region  $\phi \gg M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , where Eq. (5.177) may not be well defined. Therefore, depending on the underlying theoretical setting, the end of inflation by slow-roll violation may not be meaningful.

Let us now turn to the slow-roll trajectory. It can be integrated, giving rise to

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = \frac {x ^ {2}}{2} \left(\ln x + \frac {1}{\alpha} - \frac {1}{2}\right) - \frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}}{2} \left(\ln x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} + \frac {1}{\alpha} - \frac {1}{2}\right). (5. 1 8 3)
$$

When  $|\alpha| \ll 1$ , it approximately takes the form  $2\alpha (N_{\mathrm{end}} - N) = x^2 - x_{\mathrm{end}}^2$ . The trajectory Eq. (5.183) can be inverted making use of the Lambert function, and one obtains

$$
x ^ {2} = \frac {4 \left(N _ {\text {e n d}} - N\right) - x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2} \left[ 1 - \frac {2}{\alpha} - \ln \left(x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2}\right) \right]}{\mathrm {W}  \left\{4 \left(N _ {\text {e n d}} - N\right) e ^ {- (1 - 2 / \alpha)} - \left[ 1 - \frac {2}{\alpha} - \ln \left(x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2}\right) \right] \exp \left[ - 1 + \frac {2}{\alpha} + \ln \left(x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2}\right) \right] \right\}}, \tag {5.184}
$$

where the 0 branch of the Lambert function must be chosen if  $\alpha > 0$ , while the  $-1$  branch must be chosen if  $\alpha < 0$ . The Lambert function is displayed in the left panel of Fig. 25, together with the regions in which inflation proceeds. Let us now comment and check that this expression is valid. Firstly, if  $N = N_{\mathrm{end}}$ , the Lambert function is of the form  $\mathrm{W}(-z_{\mathrm{end}}e^{-z_{\mathrm{end}}}) = -z_{\mathrm{end}}$ , where  $z \equiv (1 - 2 / \alpha) - \ln(x^2)$ , and this automatically cancels the numerator such that one has indeed  $x = x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . Secondly, if  $\alpha > 0$ , the condition  $x_{\mathrm{end}} > x_{V=0}$  implies that  $z_{\mathrm{end}} < 1$ , and the Lambert function at  $N_{\mathrm{end}}$  is equal to  $-z_{\mathrm{end}} > -1$ . Therefore, at the end of inflation, one should use the zero branch of the Lambert function. Finally, as inflation is under way, the argument of the Lambert function is decreasing which implies that the whole inflationary stage takes place on the zero branch. On the other hand, if  $\alpha < 0$  using similar arguments, the whole inflationary stage can be shown to take place on the  $-1$  branch.

In this later case ( $\alpha < 0$ ), it is also interesting to notice that the total number of  $e$ -folds is bounded, since inflation can only proceed between  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^-$  and  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^+$ . The corresponding maximal number of  $e$ -folds  $\Delta N_{\mathrm{max}}$  is displayed, as a function of  $\alpha$ , in the right panel of

Fig. 25. One can see that when  $\alpha \lesssim -0.35$ , not a sufficient number of  $e$ -folds can be realized. For such values of  $\alpha$ , one already has  $x_{\mathrm{end}} > 10$ . Since inflation is supposed to take place at sub-Planckian vevs, it means that this regime of inflation is a priori forbidden. If one allows slightly super-Planckian field vevs, up to  $x\simeq 100$  or  $x\simeq 1000$ , this implies that  $\alpha < -0.1$ . Therefore even in this case,  $\alpha$  must lie in the rather narrow range  $-0.3 < \alpha < -0.1$ .

Making use of the approximated trajectories and expressions for  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , some analytic predictions can be derived in the case  $\alpha > 0$ . The observable field value  $x_*$ , and its associated number of  $e$ -folds  $\Delta N_* = N_{\mathrm{end}} - N_*$  at which the pivot mode crossed the Hubble radius during inflation are obtained from the above equations together with Eq. (3.48). In the limit  $\alpha \ll 1$ , one obtains the approximate expressions

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \simeq \frac {\alpha}{4 \Delta N _ {*}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2 *} \simeq \epsilon_ {3 *} \simeq \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \tag {5.185}
$$

hence

$$
r \simeq \frac {\alpha}{6 4 \Delta N _ {*}}, \qquad n _ {\mathrm {S}} - 1 \simeq - \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \qquad \alpha_ {\mathrm {S}} \simeq \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}}. (5. 1 8 6)
$$

Finally, the parameter  $M$  can be determined from the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies, and one gets

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {\alpha^ {2}}{x _ {*} ^ {2}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}} (1 + \alpha \ln x _ {*}) ^ {- 3}. \tag {5.187}
$$

In the small  $|\alpha|$  limit, one obtains  $M^4 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^4 \simeq 360\pi^2\alpha/\Delta N_*Q_{\mathrm{rms - PS}}^2 / T^2$  for  $\alpha > 0$ , and  $M^4 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^4 \simeq 720\pi^2\alpha^2 e^{2/\alpha}Q_{\mathrm{rms - PS}}^2 / T^2$  for negative values of  $\alpha$ .

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions of the loop inflation models are displayed in Fig. 140 for  $\alpha > 0$ , and in Fig. 141 for  $\alpha < 0$ . For  $\alpha > 0$  and  $\alpha \ll 1$ , the approximations in Eqs. (5.185) give a good description of what is numerically obtained, namely a deviation from scale invariance which almost does not depend on  $\alpha$ , and an amount of gravitational waves which grows linearly with  $\alpha$ . For  $\alpha < 0$ , the predictions blow out of the observational one- and two-sigma contours when  $\alpha$  approaches the upper bound derived above, as expected. Correspondingly, the parameter  $\alpha$  does not seem to be much constrained when it is positive, whereas close-to-zero values are favored when it is negative.
