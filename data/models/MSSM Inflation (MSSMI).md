The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics. Its Lagrangian is characterized by the following super potential

$$
W _ {\mathrm {M S S M}} = \lambda_ {u} ^ {i j} Q _ {i} \cdot H _ {u} U _ {j} ^ {\mathrm {c}} + \lambda_ {d} ^ {i j} Q _ {i} \cdot H _ {d} D _ {j} ^ {\mathrm {c}} + \lambda_ {e} ^ {i j} L _ {i} \cdot H _ {d} E _ {j} ^ {\mathrm {c}} + \mu H _ {u} \cdot H _ {d}. \tag {5.233}
$$

The quantity  $Q_{i}$  denotes a doublet of left handed quarks superfields where  $i$  is a family index. In practice this means that

$$
Q _ {1} = \left( \begin{array}{c} U \\ D \end{array} \right), \quad Q _ {2} = \left( \begin{array}{c} C \\ S \end{array} \right), \quad Q _ {3} = \left( \begin{array}{c} T \\ B \end{array} \right), \tag {5.234}
$$

where the components of the doublets are superfields. For instance, the scalar part of  $U$  is the  $\tilde{u}$  squark and its fermionic part is the ordinary  $u$  quark. Of course, there is also a color index  $a = 1,2,3$  and, in fact, one should write the corresponding doublet as  $Q_{ia}$ . Moreover, one can also introduce a third  $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\mathrm{L}}$  index  $\alpha = 1,2$  and write  $Q_{ia\alpha}$  with, for instance,  $Q_{1a1} = U$  and  $Q_{1a2} = D$ . On the other hand, the quantities  $U_j^c$  and  $D_j^c$  denote the right handed superfields where  $j$  is the family index (and the color index has been ignored in order to simplify the notation): for instance,  $U_2^c$  means the right handed charm quark superfield which is a singlet under  $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\mathrm{L}}$ .

In the same fashion,  $L_{i}$  denotes a doublet of left handed lepton superfields

$$
L _ {1} = \left( \begin{array}{c} N _ {e} \\ E _ {e} \end{array} \right), \quad Q _ {2} = \left( \begin{array}{c} N _ {\mu} \\ E _ {\mu} \end{array} \right), \quad Q _ {3} = \left( \begin{array}{c} N _ {\tau} \\ E _ {\tau} \end{array} \right), \tag {5.235}
$$

where, for instance,  $N_{e}$  denotes the electronic neutrino superfield (the scalar part being the neutralino and the fermionic part the electronic neutrino itself) while  $E_{e}$  denotes the electron superfield. On the other hand, the quantities  $E_{j}^{\mathrm{c}}$  denote the right handed superfields that are singlet under  $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\mathrm{L}}$  (for instance,  $E_{2}^{\mathrm{c}}$  is the right handed muonic superfield). In the superpotential (5.233), there are two terms involving the quarks and only one involving the leptons because, as well-known, there is no right handed neutrinos in the standard model.

The last term in Eq. (5.233) describes the Higgs sector with two Higgs doublet  $H_{u}$  and  $H_{d}$ . The quantity  $\mu$  is a new dimensionful (of dimension one) parameter of the model. The dot indicates an SU(2) invariant product. Finally,  $\lambda_{u},\lambda_{d},\lambda_{e}$  are the  $3\times 3$  Yukawa matrices.

From the superpotential (5.233), one can determine the scalar potential of the theory by means of the usual supersymmetric machinery. As is well-known, the scalar potential is made of two pieces, the  $F$ -term part and the  $D$ -term part. Clearly, given the number of fields in the theory, the scalar potential is a complicated object. For inflation, we are especially interested in the flat directions of this potential. A flat direction is a direction such that the  $F$  and  $D$ -terms vanish, that is to say such that  $V_{F} = 0$ ,  $V_{D} = 0$  and, therefore,  $V \equiv V_{F} + V_{D} = 0$ . It was shown that the MSSM scalar potential contains nearly 300 gauge invariant flat directions [86, 480, 481]. Finding these directions is a non-trivial task and we now very briefly explain how this can be done. Usually, it consists in putting all the fields to zero except a few ones, these few ones being carefully chosen such that cancellations occur in such a way that the potential exactly vanishes. We now illustrate this method on a particular case. Let us first recall that the general formula giving the  $D$ -term potential is

$$
V _ {D} = \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {a} g _ {a} ^ {2} D ^ {a} D ^ {a}, \tag {5.236}
$$

where  $D^{a} = \phi^{\dagger}T^{a}\phi$ ,  $T^{a}$  being the generator of the group and  $\phi$  denoting a generic field (of course, the index  $a$  should not be confused with the color index discussed above). For the standard model, we have the group  $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\mathrm{L}} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{Y}}$  and, therefore, the explicit expression of the  $D$ -term reads

$$
V _ {D} = \frac {g ^ {2}}{2} \left(D _ {1} ^ {2} + D _ {2} ^ {2} + D _ {3} ^ {2}\right) + \frac {g _ {Y}}{2} D _ {Y} ^ {2}, \tag {5.237}
$$

$g$  and  $g_{Y}$  being the coupling constants of the two groups. For the  $\mathrm{SU}(2)$  group, the generators  $T^{a}$  are nothing but the Pauli matrices and, therefore,  $T^{a} = \sigma^{a} / 2$ . Following Refs. [480, 482], let us consider a situation where all the fields in the MSSM are assumed to have a vanishing vev except  $L_{i}$  and  $E_{j}^{\mathrm{c}}$  where we remind that  $i$  and  $j$  are family indices. If we write  $L_{i}^{\uparrow}$  and  $L_{i}^{\downarrow}$  as respectively the upper and lower component of the doublet  $L_{i}$ , then one has (i.e. we put  $\phi = L_{i}$  in the general formula expressing  $D^{a}$ )

$$
D _ {1} = \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {3} \left(L _ {i} ^ {\uparrow *} L _ {i} ^ {\downarrow} + L _ {i} ^ {\downarrow *} L _ {i} ^ {\uparrow}\right), \quad D _ {2} = \frac {i}{2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {3} \left(L _ {i} ^ {\uparrow *} L _ {i} ^ {\downarrow} - L _ {i} ^ {\downarrow *} L _ {i} ^ {\uparrow}\right), \tag {5.238}
$$

$$
D _ {3} = \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {3} \left(\left| L _ {i} ^ {\uparrow} \right| ^ {2} - \left| L _ {i} ^ {\downarrow} \right| ^ {2}\right). \tag {5.239}
$$

The quantity  $E^{\mathrm{c}}$  being a SU(2) singlet does not participate to the above expression. On the other hand, the contribution from the U(1) group reads

$$
D _ {Y} = \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {3} \left(2 \left| e _ {i} \right| ^ {2} - \left| L _ {i} ^ {\uparrow} \right| ^ {2} - \left| L _ {i} ^ {\downarrow} \right| ^ {2}\right), \tag {5.240}
$$

where  $e_i$  denotes the scalar field of the  $E_i^{\mathrm{c}}$  supersymmetric multiplet. We see that, if we take

$$
L _ {i} = \left( \begin{array}{c} \phi \\ 0 \end{array} \right), \quad L _ {j} = \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ \phi \end{array} \right), \quad e _ {k} = \phi , \tag {5.241}
$$

then we have  $V_{D} = 0$

The next step consists in calculating the  $F$ -term for the choice made in Eq. (5.241). It is easy to check that  $V_{F} = 0$ . Therefore, we have identified a flat direction. It is denoted  $L_{i}L_{j}e_{k}$  or  $\mathbf{L}\mathbf{L}\mathbf{e}$  to recall that all family combination are possible. This direction is represented by a "composite operator  $X_{m}$ " formed by the product of the superfields making up the flat direction. In our case  $X_{3} = L_{i}L_{j}e_{k} = \phi^{3}$  and  $m = 3$  since we have three operators participating in the definition of  $X_{3}$ . This direction has been proposed in Ref. [483] as a possible candidate for the inflaton field. Let us also remark that another choice put forward in that reference was  $\mathbf{u}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{d}$ .

We have just seen how to identify flat directions in the MSSM potential. However, this flatness is usually spoiled by the presence of higher order non-renormalizable operators appearing in the MSSM (viewed here as a low energy effective field) and by supersymmetry breaking [86, 480, 481]. Higher order operators are described by the following superpotential

$$
W = \frac {\lambda_ {n}}{n} \frac {X _ {m} ^ {k}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {m k - 3}}, \tag {5.242}
$$

where  $\lambda_{n}$  is a coupling constant,  $n\equiv mk$  and  $k = 1$  or  $k = 2$  depending on whether the flat direction is even or odd under R-parity. Recall that  $Q,L,U^{\mathrm{c}},D^{\mathrm{c}}$  and  $E^{\mathrm{c}}$  have R-parity  $-1$  and  $H_{u},H_{d}$  have R-parity  $+1$ . It follows that LLe (for instance) has odd R-parity and, therefore, that  $k = 2$ . For the directions LLe (this is also true for uud), this means that

$$
n \equiv m k = 6. \tag {5.243}
$$

The above superpotential (5.242) will produce a term  $|\partial W / \partial \phi|^2 \propto \phi^{2(km - 1)}$  in the scalar potential. Then, we have the contributions originating from supersymmetry breaking. They

can be easily calculated if, for instance, we assume that we have an independent hidden sector where supersymmetry is broken and that this breaking is mediated by gravity only. This gives two types of soft terms, one proportional to  $\phi^2$  and another, the so-called "A-term", proportional to  $(\phi \partial W / \partial \phi + \mathrm{cc})$  that is to say, given Eq. (5.242), proportional to  $\phi^{mk}$ .

More generally, if one starts from a flat direction with a given  $n$ , then the superpotential has the form  $W = \lambda_n / n\Phi^n M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{3 - n}$ , where  $\Phi = \phi e^{i\theta}$  is the superfield which contains the flat direction. Then, the scalar potential takes the form

$$
V (\phi) = \frac {1}{2} m _ {\phi} ^ {2} \phi^ {2} + A \cos (n \theta + \theta_ {0}) \frac {\lambda_ {n}}{n} \frac {\phi^ {n}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {n - 3}} + \lambda_ {n} ^ {2} \frac {\phi^ {2 (n - 1)}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2 (n - 3)}}, \tag {5.244}
$$

where the second term involves the angular part of the superfield via a term  $\cos (n\theta +\theta_0)$  which in practice is fixed at  $-1$  to maximize its contribution. As explained below, the fact that the second term appears with a negative coefficient plays a crucial role in making this scenario a credible inflationary one.

Together with the global minimum at  $\phi = 0$ , under the condition  $A^2 \geq 8(n - 1)m_{\phi}^2$ , the potential has a secondary minimum at  $\phi_0 \simeq (m_{\phi}M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{n - 3})^{1 / (n - 2)}$ . If  $A^2 \gg 8(n - 1)m_{\phi}^2$ , this secondary minimum becomes the deepest one and thus the true one. The curvature of the potential at this minimum is of the order  $m_{\phi}^2$ . If inflation occurs there, one gets  $H \simeq m_{\phi}(m_{\phi} / M_{\mathrm{Pl}})^{1 / (n - 2)}$ , which is much smaller than the potential curvature for  $m_{\phi} \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ . This implies that the potential is too steep for quantum effects during inflaton to kick  $\phi$  out of the false minimum. Such a situation is similar to the old inflationary scenario. However, this barrier disappears if one saturates the previous inequality and takes

$$
A ^ {2} = 8 (n - 1) m _ {\phi} ^ {2}. \tag {5.245}
$$

In that case, the potential has a flat inflection point at  $\phi_0$  and inflation can proceed between this plateau and  $\phi = 0$ . This is the case we study in this section. This model (and its generalizations) has also been studied in Refs. [484-496]. Its generalizations will be investigated in more details in section 6.6 and section 6.7. Let also us notice that when  $n = 3$ , the same potential appears in Refs. [497, 498] as "Generalized Chaotic Inflation", and later in Refs. [499-501] as "Punctuated Inflation". In these references, it is shown that slow-roll inflation is briefly interrupted when the inflaton crosses the flat inflection point and this can produce step-like features in the primordial power spectra. These effects are outside the scope of the following slow-roll analysis as we will be dealing with the last slow-roll inflationary stage within this scenario.

# Slow-Roll Analysis

We now turn to the slow-roll analysis of MSSM inflation. As discussed before, we assume that the inflaton is the flat direction LLe or uud. This implies that  $n = 6$  in Eq. (5.244). Then, rewriting the potential (5.244) in a more convenient fashion, one arrives at

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} - \frac {2}{3} \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {6} + \frac {1}{5} \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {1 0} \right], \tag {5.246}
$$

where we have defined new parameters according to

$$
M ^ {8} = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {3} m _ {\phi} ^ {5}}{4 \sqrt {1 0} \lambda_ {6}}, \quad \phi_ {0} ^ {8} = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {6} m _ {\phi} ^ {2}}{1 0 \lambda_ {6} ^ {2}}. \tag {5.247}
$$

These definitions and the value of the coefficients ensure that  $\phi_0$  is the location of a flat inflection point. Since  $m_{\phi}^{2}\phi^{2}$  is a soft SUSY breaking term, we typically expect that  $m_{\phi} \simeq 1$  TeV and this is the reason why, in what follows, typical values of the field are taken to be

$$
\phi_ {0} \simeq 1 0 ^ {1 4} \mathrm {G e V}, \tag {5.248}
$$

in agreement with the second of Eqs. (5.247) (the coupling constant  $\lambda_{6}$  is taken to be of order one). An interesting feature of this model is that it provides inflation at sub-Planckian  $v_{ev}$  and at low scale  $V\simeq (10^{9}\mathrm{GeV})^{4}$ . As noticed in Ref. [483], higher values than  $n = 6$  would produce too small amplitude for the scalar perturbations. This is why the model is commonly studied with  $n = 6$  (with  $n = 3$ , this is RIPI, see section 5.18).

The potential in Eq. (5.246) is displayed in Fig. 32, together with its logarithm. It is an increasing function of the field, the derivative of which vanishes at  $\phi = 0$  and at its second inflection point  $\phi = \phi_0$ , the position of the first inflection point being given by  $\phi_{V''=0}^- = \phi_0 / \sqrt{3}$ . Inflation proceeds in the region  $\phi \in [0, \phi_0]$ , in the direction specified by the arrow in Fig. 32.

Defining the dimensionless quantity  $x$  by

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}, \tag {5.249}
$$

the first three Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = 4 5 0 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {\left(x ^ {4} - 1\right) ^ {4}}{x ^ {2} \left(3 x ^ {8} - 1 0 x ^ {4} + 1 5\right) ^ {2}}, \qquad \epsilon_ {2} = 6 0 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {3 x ^ {1 6} - 5 8 x ^ {8} + 4 0 x ^ {4} + 1 5}{x ^ {2} \left(3 x ^ {8} - 1 0 x ^ {4} + 1 5\right) ^ {2}}, \qquad (5. 2 5 0)
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \epsilon_ {3} = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {6 0}{x ^ {2}} \left(- 2 2 5 + 1 5 7 5 x ^ {4} - 3 1 6 5 x ^ {8} + 3 9 5 x ^ {1 2} + 2 6 0 5 x ^ {1 6} - 1 2 7 5 x ^ {2 0} + 8 1 x ^ {2 4} + 9 x ^ {2 8}\right) \\ \times \left(3 x ^ {8} - 1 0 x ^ {4} + 1 5\right) ^ {- 2} \times \left(- 1 5 - 5 5 x ^ {4} + 3 x ^ {8} + 3 x ^ {1 2}\right) ^ {- 1}. \tag {5.251} \\ \end{array}
$$

These two slow-roll parameters diverge when the field  $vev$  goes to 0, and vanish when the field  $vev$  goes to infinity. The first slow roll parameter  $\epsilon_{1}$  first decreases, vanishes at the flat inflection point where  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes too, then increases to reach a local maximum where  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes again, and eventually decreases again, to vanish at infinity where  $\epsilon_{2}$  also goes to zero. Denoting by  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^+$  the position of the second extremum, one has

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {+} = \left(\frac {1}{3}\right) ^ {1 / 4} \left[ 2 ^ {4 / 3} (i \sqrt {6 8 5} - 1) ^ {1 / 3} + 1 4 \times 2 ^ {2 / 3} (i \sqrt {6 8 5} - 1) ^ {- 1 / 3} - 1 \right] ^ {1 / 4} \simeq 1. 4 1 0 2 2. \tag {5.252}
$$

In between the two local extrema of  $\epsilon_{1}$ , the second slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{2}$  is negative whereas it is positive elsewhere. The value of  $\epsilon_{1}$  at its local maximum is given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} ^ {\max } = \epsilon_ {1} \left(x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {+}\right) \simeq 3 4. 4 5 9 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}. \tag {5.253}
$$

With the typical above-mentioned value for  $\phi_0\simeq 10^{14}\mathrm{GeV}$ , one has  $M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 /\phi_0^2\simeq 10^8$  and  $\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}} > 1$ . This means that if inflation proceeds for vev's larger than that of the flat inflection point, it can naturally stop by slow-roll violation. However, if this happens, inflation proceeds at  $x\gg 1$  and the potential is effectively very close to a large field model one (LFI, see section 5.2) with  $p = 10$ .

For this reason, we will be focused to the case in which inflation occurs for  $vev$ 's smaller than that of the flat inflection point. In this case, the value of  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  at which inflation stops by slow-roll violation must be determined numerically. In the limit  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \ll 1$  however, one has  $x_{\mathrm{end}} \simeq 1$  and an approximate analytic formula can be derived

$$
x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} \simeq 1 - \frac {1}{2 ^ {3 / 4} \sqrt {1 5}} \sqrt {\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}}. \tag {5.254}
$$

A comparison between this expression and the numerical solution of  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$  is displayed in Fig. 33. For physical values  $\phi_0\simeq 10^{-4}M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the agreement is excellent.

Let us now turn to the slow-roll trajectory. It can be integrated from Eq. (3.11) and leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l} N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2} \left\{\frac {x ^ {2} - x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}}{2 0} + \frac {1}{1 5} \left(\frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}}{x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {4} - 1} - \frac {x ^ {2}}{x ^ {4} - 1}\right) \right. \\ \left. - \frac {2}{1 5} \left[ \operatorname {a r c t a n h} \left(x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}\right) - \operatorname {a r c t a n h} \left(x ^ {2}\right) \right] \right\}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $N_{\mathrm{end}}$  is the number of  $e$ -folds at the end of inflation and  $N$  is the number of  $e$ -folds at some point when the scaled field  $vev$  is  $x$ . A few remarks are in order. Firstly, when

$x\simeq 1$ , the second term of the previous expression dominates, and one has  $N_{\mathrm{end}} - N\simeq 1 / 15(\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}})^2 [1 / (x_{\mathrm{end}}^4 -1) - 1 / (x^4 -1)]$ , which can be inverted and gives

$$
x \simeq 1 - \frac {1}{4} \left[ 2 ^ {- 5 / 4} \sqrt {1 5} \sqrt {\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}} + 1 5 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} (N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N) \right] ^ {- 1}. \tag {5.255}
$$

Secondly, one could wonder if a sufficient number of  $e$ -folds can be realized in the regime studied here. When  $x \to 1$ , the corresponding number of  $e$ -folds diverges, but in practice, the inflationary dynamics close to the flat inflection point is governed by the quantum diffusion and the classical equation of motion cannot be trusted in this domain.

If one introduces the ratio  $\eta$  between the quantum kicks amplitude  $H / (2\pi)$  and the classical drift  $M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 V_\phi /V$ , when  $x\simeq 1$ , one has

$$
\eta \simeq \frac {1}{9 0 \sqrt {3 0} \pi} M ^ {2} \phi_ {0} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {- 3} (x - 1) ^ {- 2} \simeq \frac {4 \sqrt {1 0}}{\pi \sqrt {3}} M ^ {2} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} \phi_ {0} ^ {- 3} (N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N) ^ {2}, \tag {5.256}
$$

where the last equality comes from the approximate trajectory. In order to estimate the value of  $\eta$ , one needs the value of  $M$  which is fixed by the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies. With  $x_{*}$  the observable field value associated with  $\Delta N_{*} = N_{\mathrm{end}} - N_{*}$ , one gets

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 2 8 8 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {\left(1 - x _ {*} ^ {4}\right) ^ {4}}{x _ {*} ^ {4} \left(1 - \frac {2}{3} x _ {*} ^ {4} + \frac {1}{5} x _ {*} ^ {8}\right) ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. (5. 2 5 7)
$$

In the  $x_{*}\simeq 1$  approximation, this gives

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} \simeq \frac {3}{8} \pi^ {2} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {6}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {6} (N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N _ {*}) ^ {4}}, \tag {5.258}
$$

and thus

$$
\eta \simeq \sqrt {2 0 \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}} \left(\frac {N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N}{\Delta N _ {*}}\right) ^ {2}. (5. 2 5 9)
$$

It is quite remarkable that this formula does not depend on  $\phi_0$  anymore but only on the ratio  $(N_{\mathrm{end}} - N) / \Delta N_*$ . From  $Q_{\mathrm{rms - PS}} / T\simeq 6\times 10^{-6}$ , one has  $N_{\mathrm{end}} - N_{\mathrm{min}}\simeq 10^4$  in the classical regime [483]. For  $\phi_0\simeq 10^{14}\mathrm{GeV}$ , one obtains  $M\simeq 10^{8}\mathrm{GeV}$ , in agreement with what was announced earlier.

Finally, it can be interesting to write down the approximated slow-roll parameters at Hubble crossing and in the limit  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \ll 1$ . One obtains

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \simeq \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {6} \frac {1}{7 2 0 0 \Delta N _ {*} ^ {4}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2 *} \simeq \frac {4}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \quad \epsilon_ {3 *} \simeq \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \tag {5.260}
$$

hence

$$
r \simeq \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {6} \frac {1}{4 5 0 \Delta N _ {*} ^ {4}}, \qquad n _ {\mathrm {S}} \simeq 1 - \frac {4}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \qquad \alpha_ {\mathrm {S}} \simeq - \frac {4}{\Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}}. \qquad (5. 2 6 1)
$$

They are similar with the typical predictions of the RIPI models [see Eq. (5.277)].

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions of the MSSMI models are displayed in Fig. 150. The reheating equation of state parameter  $\overline{w}_{\mathrm{reh}}$  has been taken to 0 since the potential is quadratic in the vicinity of its minimum. One can check that, in the limit  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \ll 1$ , the first slow-roll parameter is indeed extremely small, while the second slow-roll parameter does not depend much on  $\phi_0$ . Remembering that  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-4}$ , one can see that these models seem to be disfavored by the data since they predict a too large deviation from scale invariance. In order to better reproduce the constraints on the spectral index, these models should be such that  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \gg 1$ , for which they become similar to large field models (LFI, see section 5.2). This can be seen from the previous formulas in the limit  $x \gg 1$ . Unfortunately, such values for  $\phi_0$  are not compatible with the MSSM. Finally, comparing Fig. 150 with Fig. 151, one can see that the general features of MSSMI are very similar to the RIPI ones, and that the conclusions drawn here are rather robust against a change in  $n$  appearing in Eq. (5.244).
