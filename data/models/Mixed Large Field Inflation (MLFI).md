# Mixed Large Field Inflation (MLFI)

This model is a generalization of the LFI model  $V(\phi) \propto \phi^p$ , see section 5.2, where two monomials  $\propto \phi^2$  and  $\propto \phi^4$  are added. The MLFI potential reads

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \frac {\phi^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left(1 + \alpha \frac {\phi^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}\right), \tag {5.45}
$$

where  $\alpha$  is a positive dimensionless parameter. If  $\phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\ll 1 / \sqrt{\alpha}$ , then the potential is of the LFI type with  $p = 2$ , i.e.  $V(\phi)\simeq M^4\phi^2 /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2$ , whereas if  $\phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\gg 1 / \sqrt{\alpha}$ , the potential

is of the LFI type with  $p = 4$ , i.e.  $V(\phi) \simeq M_4^4\alpha\phi^4 /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^4$ . Clearly, the interesting regime is when  $\phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 1 / \sqrt{\alpha}$ , where the two terms are of equal importance. The potential and its logarithm are displayed in Fig. 11. We notice that  $V(\phi)$  is an increasing function of the field  $vev$  and, as a consequence, that inflation proceeds from the right to the left.

This model has been investigated in different contexts. Of course, the shape of the potential appears to be natural and well-motivated since it just represents a free theory (with particles of mass  $2M^4 /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2$ ) corrected by the usual self-interacting quartic term. Therefore, it does not come as a surprise that this potential has been used in many different works. In Ref. [303], this model is studied in the case where a bulk scalar field is driving inflation in large extra dimensions. In Ref. [304], it is considered in a situation where inflation is driven by highly excited quantum states. In Refs. [305-307], the MLFI potential is utilized in the context of "fresh inflation". The same potential was again considered in Ref. [308] where the role of inflaton is played by the Higgs triplet in a model where the type II seesaw mechanism is used to generate the small masses of left-handed neutrinos. Finally, it is also

studied in Ref. [309] where supersymmetric hybrid inflation (in the framework of the Randall-Sundrum type II Braneworld model) is considered. The only constraint on the parameters of the model that is (sometimes) required is that the self-interacting term should be subdominant. This leads to the condition  $\alpha M^4 /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^4\ll 1$ . Given the typical values imposed by CMB normalization, i.e.  $M / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\simeq 10^{-3}$  [see Eq. (5.44)], this is not very stringent and  $\alpha$  can in fact vary in a quite large range of values.

Defining  $x \equiv \phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the three first slow-roll parameters can be expressed as

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {2}{x ^ {2}} \left(\frac {1 + 2 \alpha x ^ {2}}{1 + \alpha x ^ {2}}\right) ^ {2}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \frac {4}{x ^ {2}} \frac {1 + \alpha x ^ {2} + 2 \alpha^ {2} x ^ {4}}{\left(1 + \alpha x ^ {2}\right) ^ {2}}, \tag {5.46}
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_ {3} = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{x ^ {2}} \frac {1 + 2 \alpha x ^ {2}}{\left(1 + \alpha x ^ {2}\right) ^ {2}} \frac {4 + 1 2 \alpha x ^ {2} + 8 \alpha^ {3} x ^ {6}}{1 + \alpha x ^ {2} + 2 \alpha^ {2} x ^ {4}}. \tag {5.47}
$$

They are displayed in Fig. 11. We see that the three slow-roll parameters are decreasing functions of the field  $vev$ , which means that they are all increasing functions during inflation. As a consequence, inflation can stop by violation of the slow-roll conditions at  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  given by  $\epsilon_1 = 1$  (see below). We also notice that  $\epsilon_2$  and  $\epsilon_3$  are larger than one at  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . This means that the slow-roll approximation breaks down slightly before the end of inflation and that the last few  $e$ -folds of inflation may be not properly described by the slow-roll approximation.

Let us now study the slow-roll trajectory. It is given by

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = - \frac {1}{8} \left[ x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} + \frac {1}{2 \alpha} \ln \left(1 + 2 \alpha x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}\right) - x ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2 \alpha} \ln \left(1 + 2 \alpha x ^ {2}\right) \right], \tag {5.48}
$$

where  $N_{\mathrm{end}}$  is the number of  $e$ -folds at the end of inflation. One can check that this expression is asymptotically correct. Indeed, when  $\alpha \ll 1$ , the slow-roll trajectory reduces to

$$
x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} = x ^ {2} - 4 \left(N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N\right), \tag {5.49}
$$

which is the trajectory in the massive case, i.e. LFI with  $p = 2$ , see Eq. (5.36). On the other hand, in the limit  $\alpha \to \infty$ , one obtains

$$
x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} = x ^ {2} - 8 \left(N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N\right), \tag {5.50}
$$

which is, as expected, the slow-roll trajectory in the quartic case, i.e. LFI with  $p = 4$ . In general, the trajectory can be inverted and expressed in terms of the Lambert function. Straightforward manipulations lead to

$$
x = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2 \alpha}} \sqrt {- 1 + \mathrm {W} _ {0} \left[ e ^ {1 + 2 \alpha x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}} \left(1 + 2 \alpha x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}\right) e ^ {- 1 6 \alpha (N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}})} \right]}. \tag {5.51}
$$

The corresponding Lambert function is displayed in Fig. 12, together with the region where inflation proceeds.

We have seen that, in MLFI, inflation stops by violation of the slow-roll condition. Let us therefore determine the corresponding  $vev$  of the field. The condition  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$  leads to

$$
\alpha x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {3} - 2 \sqrt {2} \alpha x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2} + x _ {\text {e n d}} - \sqrt {2} = 0. \tag {5.52}
$$

This is a cubic algebraic equation that can be solved exactly. In the limit  $\alpha \gg 1$ , the solution reads  $x_{\mathrm{end}} \simeq 2\sqrt{2}$  which is indeed the solution for the quartic case, see Eq. (5.38). On the

other hand, if  $\alpha \ll 1$ , then  $x_{\mathrm{end}} \simeq \sqrt{2}$  which is also the correct result for the quadratic case. The general solution is

$$
\begin{array}{l} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = \frac {2 \sqrt {2}}{3} + \frac {1}{3 \alpha} \bigg \{\frac {1}{4 \sqrt {2}} \bigg [ 4 \alpha^ {2} (3 2 \alpha + 9) + 2 \alpha \sqrt {4 \alpha^ {2} (3 2 \alpha + 9) ^ {2} - 8 \alpha (8 \alpha - 3) ^ {3}} \bigg ] \bigg \} ^ {1 / 3} \\ + \frac {1}{3} (8 \alpha - 3) \left\{\frac {1}{4 \sqrt {2}} \left[ 4 \alpha^ {2} (3 2 \alpha + 9) + 2 \alpha \sqrt {4 \alpha^ {2} (3 2 \alpha + 9) ^ {2} - 8 \alpha (8 \alpha - 3) ^ {3}} \right] \right\} ^ {- 1 / 3}, \tag {5.53} \\ \end{array}
$$

which is the one used in the ASPIC library.

Finally, the parameter  $M$  can be determined from the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies, and one gets

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = \frac {2 8 8 0 \pi^ {2}}{x ^ {4}} \frac {\left(1 + 2 \alpha x _ {*} ^ {2}\right) ^ {2}}{\left(1 + \alpha x _ {*} ^ {2}\right) ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.54}
$$

Similarly to LFI (see section 5.2), this gives rise to  $M / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-3}$ . The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the MLFI models are displayed in Fig. 128. The reheating equation of state parameter  $\overline{w}_{\mathrm{reh}}$  has been taken to 0 which is consistent with the fact that the potential is quadratic close to its minimum. As expected, when  $\alpha \ll 1$  the predictions of the model match those of LFI with  $p = 2$  and are aligned along the  $\epsilon_1 = \epsilon_2 / 2$  line. On the other hand, if  $\alpha \gg 1$ , then the predictions are consistent with those of LFI with  $p = 4$  and are aligned along the  $\epsilon_1 = \epsilon_2$  line. In the intermediate regime, it is interesting to notice that the MLFI predictions continuously interpolate between these two asymptotic solutions but

do not remain inside the domain delimited by those two lines. Indeed, when  $\alpha$  is larger than some value, one has  $\epsilon_1 > \epsilon_2$ . This means that, if one starts from a pure quartic potential (LFI with  $p = 4$ ) and adds a small quadratic term, this extra term has the effect of increasing the "effective value" of  $p$ , which is quite counter intuitive. On the other hand, since the quadratic model fits better the data than the quartic one, small values for the parameter  $\alpha$  are favored (all the models with  $\alpha > 10^{-3}$  lie outside the  $2\sigma$  contour of the Planck 2018 + Bicep-Keck data). High reheating temperatures are also preferred.
