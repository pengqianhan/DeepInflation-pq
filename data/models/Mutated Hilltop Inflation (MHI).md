# Mutated Hilltop Inflation (MHI)

This model belongs to the class of hilltop models [474, 475]. In this type of scenarios, inflation is supposed to occur at the top of the potential. In particular, it was shown in Refs. [474, 475] that, by adding the contributions coming from higher order operators,  $F$  or  $D$  term inflation can be turned into hilltop models. Here, we consider mutated hilltop inflation which was first introduced and discussed in Refs. [476, 477]. The potential is phenomenological only and given by

$$
V = M ^ {4} \left[ 1 - \operatorname {s e c h} \left(\frac {\phi}{\mu}\right) \right], \tag {5.215}
$$

with sech  $x = 1 / \cosh x$ . As argued in Refs. [476, 477], it can be viewed as small field inflation (hilltop inflation) completed by an infinite number of higher order operators, these operators giving rise to a power series responsible for the appearance of the sech function. From an effective field theory point of view, reasonable values of the parameter  $\mu$  seem to be such that  $\mu < M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  but in other contexts such a restriction may not be necessary. This is why although the model is studied for any value of  $\mu$ , approximated formula will also be derived in the  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  approximation.

Defining  $x \equiv \phi / \mu$ , the three first Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{2 \mu^ {2}} \coth^ {2} \left(\frac {x}{2}\right) \operatorname {s e c h} ^ {2} x, \qquad \epsilon_ {2} = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}} \left[ \operatorname {c s c h} ^ {2} \left(\frac {x}{2}\right) + 2 \operatorname {s e c h} ^ {2} x \right], \qquad (5. 2 1 6)
$$

$$
\epsilon_ {3} = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}} \frac {\cosh x \coth^ {2} \left(\frac {x}{2}\right) + 2 \tanh ^ {2} x}{\cosh x + \sinh^ {2} x}. \tag {5.217}
$$

where  $\operatorname{csch} x = 1 / \sinh x$ . These three quantities are monotonic decreasing functions of the field values and inflation proceeds from large field values towards small field values. Together with the potential, they are represented as a function of  $x$  in Fig. 29.

The slow-roll trajectory can be integrated exactly from Eq. (3.11) and reads

$$
N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = \frac {\mu^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left\{2 \ln \left[ \frac {\cosh (x / 2)}{\cosh (x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} / 2)} \right] - \cosh x + \cosh x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} \right\}. \tag {5.218}
$$

It can also be inverted analytically to give the field values in terms of the number of  $e$ -folds using the Lambert function  $\mathrm{W}_{-1}$ . One obtains

$$
x = \operatorname {a r c c o s h} \left(- 1 - \mathrm {W} _ {- 1} \left\{- (1 + \cosh x _ {\text {e n d}}) \exp \left[ \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}} (N - N _ {\text {e n d}}) - 1 - \cosh x _ {\text {e n d}} \right] \right\}\right). \tag {5.219}
$$

Since  $N - N_{\mathrm{end}} < 0$  and the function  $ye^{-y}$  has a global maximum equals to  $1 / e$ , inflation proceeds along the  $-1$  branch of the Lambert function as represented in Fig. 30. Note that in the  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  limit, this trajectory simply becomes  $N - N_{\mathrm{end}} \simeq \mu^2 /(2M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2)(e^{x_{\mathrm{end}}} - e^x)$ .

For MHI, inflation naturally stops when  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$ , which has an unique solution given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = \operatorname {a r c s e c h} \left[ - \frac {1}{3} + \frac {1}{3} \left(1 - 6 \frac {\mu^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}\right) \left(- 1 + 3 6 \frac {\mu^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + 3 \sqrt {6} \frac {\mu}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} \sqrt {4 \frac {\mu^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} + 2 2 \frac {\mu^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} - 1}\right) ^ {- 1 / 3} \right. \\ \left. + \frac {1}{3} \left(- 1 + 3 6 \frac {\mu^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + 3 \sqrt {6} \frac {\mu}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} \sqrt {4 \frac {\mu^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} + 2 2 \frac {\mu^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} - 1}\right) ^ {1 / 3} \right], \tag {5.220} \\ \end{array}
$$

and with  $\operatorname{arcsech} x = \operatorname{arccosh}(1/x)$ . One should note that the previous equation is always well defined, regardless of the sign of the square root argument by analytic continuation. Let us notice that from Eq. (5.216) one has

$$
\epsilon_ {2} - \epsilon_ {1} = \frac {1}{2} \operatorname {c s c h} ^ {2} \left(\frac {x}{2}\right) + \operatorname {s e c h} x + \frac {5}{2} \operatorname {s e c h} ^ {2} x > 0. \tag {5.221}
$$

Consequently, the slow-roll approximation may become inaccurate before the end of inflation because  $\epsilon_{2} > 1$  occurs just before  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$ . However, one can check that this happens during a

negligible number of  $e$ -folds and the observable predictions for MHI remain mostly unaffected. Also, in the limit  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , Eq. (5.220) gives  $x_{\mathrm{end}} \simeq \ln \left( \sqrt{2} M_{\mathrm{Pl}} / \mu \right)$ .

The value  $x_{*} = \phi_{*} / \mu$  at which the pivot mode crossed the Hubble radius during inflation is obtained by solving Eq. (3.48) for a given reheating energy. In terms of  $\Delta N_{*}$ , and in the limit  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , one has  $x_{*} \simeq \ln \left(2\Delta N_{*}M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{2} / \mu^{2}\right)$ . This enables to give estimates for the slow-roll parameters at Hubble crossing, namely

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \simeq \frac {1}{2 \Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}} \left(\frac {\mu}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2}, \quad \epsilon_ {2 *} \simeq \frac {2}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \quad \epsilon_ {3 *} \simeq \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \tag {5.222}
$$

hence, at first order in slow-roll

$$
r \simeq \frac {8}{\Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}} \left(\frac {\mu}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2}, \quad n _ {\mathrm {S}} - 1 \simeq - \frac {2}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \quad \alpha_ {\mathrm {S}} \simeq - \frac {2}{\Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}}. \tag {5.223}
$$

One can see that for  $\mu / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \ll 1$ , the typical predicted amount of gravitational waves is very small, and the deviation from scale invariance almost does not depend on  $\mu$ .

Finally, the constant  $M$  can be determined from the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} = 9 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}} \operatorname {c s c h} ^ {6} \left(\frac {x _ {*}}{2}\right) \sinh x _ {*} \tanh x _ {*} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.224}
$$

In the  $\mu /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\ll 1$  limit, one obtains

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} \simeq \frac {7 2 0 \pi^ {2}}{\Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}} \frac {\mu^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s} - \mathrm {P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.225}
$$

Typically, for  $\mu /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\simeq 10^{-2}$  , one has  $M / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\simeq 10^{-4}$

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for MHI have been represented in Fig. 148. As expected, for small values of  $\mu /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the predicted amount of gravitational waves is extremely small and the deviation from scale invariance almost does not depend on  $\mu$ .
