# N-Formalism Inflation (NFI)

# Theoretical Justifications

This model is phenomenological and motivated by the search of "universality classes" for slow-roll inflation as originally proposed in Ref. [708]. There, it was argued that most of the observationally relevant inflationary models should lead to a first Hubble flow function varying as

$$
\epsilon_ {1} \propto \frac {1}{\Delta N ^ {\alpha}}, \tag {7.155}
$$

the higher-order terms of an expansion in  $1 / \Delta N_{*}$  being neglected. This idea was later proven to not encompass not all relevant models, and to lead to insufficiently accurate predictions in light of the precision of the CMB data in Ref. [28]. However, it is still possible to search for models verifying Eq. (7.155) at leading order in slow-roll. Plugging Eq. (7.155) into the definition of the first Hubble-flow function given in Eq. (3.8), one gets  $\Delta \phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\propto \Delta N^{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}}$  with  $\Delta \phi = \phi_{\mathrm{end}} - \phi$ , which implies

$$
\frac {1}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} \frac {\mathrm {d} \phi}{\mathrm {d} N} \propto \frac {1}{\Delta N ^ {\frac {\alpha}{2}}} \propto \left(\frac {\Delta \phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {- \frac {\alpha}{\alpha - 2}}. \tag {7.156}
$$

From the slow-roll trajectory given in Eq. (3.10), one gets

$$
\frac {\mathrm {d} \ln V}{\mathrm {d} \phi} \propto \frac {1}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} \left(\frac {\Delta \phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {\frac {\alpha}{\alpha - 2}}. \tag {7.157}
$$

Ignoring the singular case  $\alpha = 2$ , the potential verifies

$$
\ln \left(\frac {V}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}}\right) \propto \left(\frac {\Delta \phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {\frac {2 (\alpha - 1)}{\alpha - 2}}, \tag {7.158}
$$

and is an exponential function of some power of the field.

# Slow-roll Analysis

Let us write the potential of NFI under the more convenient form

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} e ^ {- a \left(\frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {b}}, \tag {7.159}
$$

where  $a$  and  $b$  are two dimensionless parameters. The peculiar case  $b = 1$  is Power Law Inflation (PLI) discussed in section 5.8 and will not be further discussed in the following. Using

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}, \tag {7.160}
$$

the Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation read

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {1}{2} a ^ {2} b ^ {2} x ^ {2 (b - 1)}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = 2 a b (b - 1) x ^ {b - 2}, \quad \epsilon_ {3} = a b (b - 2) x ^ {b - 2}. \tag {7.161}
$$

When  $b$  is not an integer, the potential is well-defined only for  $x > 0$  but could be extended in the negative domain otherwise (see below). The solution to  $\epsilon_1 = 1$  is given by

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {1} = 1} \equiv \left(\frac {2}{a ^ {2} b ^ {2}}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2 (b - 1)}}, \tag {7.162}
$$

and one can see that inflation can only take place in the domains  $x < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  for  $b > 1$  and in the domains  $x > x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  for  $b < 1$ . Moreover, depending on the sign of both  $a$  and  $b$ , the potential, within the positive domain  $x > 0$ , can either be an increasing or a decreasing function of the field value. If the potential drives the field away from  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  then inflation requires an additional mechanism to end. In this situation,  $\phi_{\mathrm{end}}$ , the field value at which inflation ends

is an additional model parameter making NFI a three-parameter model. However, if the potential drives the field towards  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  then inflation can gracefully end and the model has only two parameters in that case.

For these reasons we distinguish four regimes. The first, NFI1, obtained for  $a > 0$  and  $b > 1$ , is associated with a decreasing potential with respect to  $x$ , inflation proceeds at increasing field values and naturally ends at  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$ . The second regime, referred to as NFI2, corresponds to  $a < 0$  and  $b > 1$ . The potential is an increasing function of the field, inflation proceeds at decreasing field values moving away from  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$ . The third regime, NFI3, is obtained for either  $a < 0$  and  $0 < b < 1$ , or,  $a > 0$  and  $b < 0$ . It is associated with a increasing potential with respect to  $x$ , inflation occurring at decreasing field values and moving towards  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  with a graceful ending. Finally, NFI4 is obtained for either  $a > 0$  and  $0 < b < 1$ , or,  $a < 0$  and  $b < 0$ . Inflation proceeds at increasing field values, moving away from  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  and requiring an additional mechanism to stop. The potential and the Hubble-flow functions for the regimes NFI1 and NFI2 have been represented in figure 117 while NFI3 and NFI4 are shown in figure 118. Figure 119 shows the location of these four inflationary regimes in the parameter space  $(a,b)$ .

The integer values of  $b$  allow for the potential to be extended into the domain  $x < 0$ . For

even values of  $b$ , the potential of Eq. (7.159) is symmetric under the transformation  $\phi \rightarrow -\phi$  such that, at negative field values, inflation proceeds exactly as in the positive domain. For odd values of  $b$ , the potential remains unchanged under the transformation  $\phi \rightarrow -\phi$  combined with  $a \rightarrow -a$ . As a result, inflation in the negative domain of NFI1 is the same as inflation in the positive domain of NFI2, and conversely. This symmetry also unifies the negative domain of NFI3 with the positive domain of NFI4, and conversely. All in all, we can restrict the analysis to  $x > 0$  in all possible situations.

The slow-roll trajectory can be integrated analytically and reads

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = \frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2 - b} - x ^ {2 - b}}{a b (2 - b)}. \tag {7.163}
$$

The case  $b = 2$  is included as the regular logarithmic limit of this expression. The trajectory can be inverted into

$$
x = \left[ x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2 - b} - a b (2 - b) \left(N _ {\text {e n d}} - N\right) \right] ^ {\frac {1}{2 - b}}, \tag {7.164}
$$

which matches the one of Small Field Inflation (SFI) in the deep sub-Planckian limit, see Eq. (6.12). The case  $b = 2$  can be dealt by starting with the logarithmic limit of Eq. (7.163) and one gets a pure exponential term

$$
x = x _ {\text {e n d}} e ^ {- 2 a \left(N _ {\text {e n d}} - N\right)}. \tag {7.165}
$$

As already mentioned, for NFI1 and NFI3 we have  $x_{\mathrm{end}} = x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  given in Eq. (7.162) whereas  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  is an additional model parameter for NFI2 and NFI4. Let us notice that for  $b > 2$ ,

Eq. (7.163) diverges for  $x \to 0$  and the maximal number of  $e$ -folds achievable at the origin of the potential is unbounded. In the opposite situation, for  $b < 2$ , this implies that there is a maximal acceptable value for  $|a|$  to have enough  $e$ -folds of NFI1 inflation between  $x = 0$  and  $x_{\mathrm{end}} = x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$ . Similarly,  $|a|$  should be small enough to have enough  $e$ -folds of NFI2 inflation between  $x_{\mathrm{ini}}^{\max} = x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  and  $x_{\mathrm{end}}^{\min} = 0$ . In the regime NFI3 one always has  $b < 1$  and the number of  $e$ -folds is unbounded. The regime NFI4 proceeds at  $x > x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  and the number of  $e$ -folds can be made as large as needed by choosing the free parameter  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  large enough.

From the trajectory of Eq. (7.163), combined with the reheating equation (3.48) and the field value  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  at which inflation ends, one obtains  $x_*$ , the field value at which the pivot mode crossed the Hubble radius during inflation. The mass scale  $M$  of the potential is then fixed by the CMB normalization and verifies

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} a ^ {2} b ^ {2} e ^ {a x _ {*} ^ {b}} x _ {*} ^ {2 (b - 1)} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {7.166}
$$

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the four NFI regimes are represented in Figs. 469 to 487. Let us remark that plugging Eq. (7.164) within the expression of the Hubble-flow functions given in Eq. (7.161), one obtains

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} = \frac {a ^ {2} b ^ {2}}{2 \left[ x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2 - b} + a b (b - 2) \Delta N _ {*} \right] ^ {\frac {2 b - 2}{b - 2}}}. \tag {7.167}
$$

For  $b > 2$ , in the regime NFI1, for  $a$  small enough one can neglect  $x_{\mathrm{end}} = x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}$  compared to the term containing  $\Delta N_*$ . In this limit one recovers the power-law behavior of Eq. (7.155), namely

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \propto \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*} ^ {\frac {2 b - 2}{b - 2}}}. \tag {7.168}
$$

Notice that the case  $\epsilon_{1*} \propto 1 / \Delta N_*^2$  (which appeared as singular in the introductory discussion of this section) corresponds to the asymptotic limit  $b \to +\infty$  while other values of  $b > 2$  produce higher-than-two power-law exponents. Less-than-unity positive exponents can be generated within NFI2 with  $0 < b < 1$  and  $a < 0$  while choosing  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  very small. Exponents between one and two can be generated within NFI3 for  $b < 0$  and a small enough  $a > 0$ . When the contribution from  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  is not negligible, the model predictions deviate from this simple power law. It is also interesting to remark that the peculiar case  $b = 2$ , generating the exponential trajectory of Eq. (7.165), yields

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} = \frac {2 a ^ {2} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}}{e ^ {4 a \Delta N _ {*}}}, \tag {7.169}
$$

which is quite different from a power-law dependence in  $1 / \Delta N_{*}$ . There is nothing surprising in this result as the potential of NFI written in Eq. (7.159) has been derived from Eq. (7.155) as a leading-order approximation only. The proper way to devise an inflationary model generating a given functional shape for  $\epsilon_1(N)$  exactly is what is presented for VFMI in section 6.21.
