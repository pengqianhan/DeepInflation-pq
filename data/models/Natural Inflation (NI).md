# Natural Inflation (NI)

# Theoretical Justifications

Natural inflation was first proposed as an attempt to solve the so-called "fine-tuning" problem of inflation. In particular, in order to obtain sufficient inflation and the correct normalization for the microwave background anisotropies, the potential  $V(\phi)$  of the inflaton must be sufficiently flat. It is usually argued that, on general grounds, such a flatness is not robust under radiative corrections, unless it is protected by some symmetry. This is the reason that has motivated Refs. [311, 312] to put forward Natural Inflation, in which the inflaton potential is flat due to shift symmetries. The model makes use of Nambu-Goldstone bosons [313, 314] which arise whenever a global symmetry is spontaneously broken. The main idea can be very simply illustrated with the following action

$$
\begin{array}{l} S = - \int \mathrm {d} \boldsymbol {x} \sqrt {- g} \left[ g ^ {\mu \nu} \partial_ {\mu} \Phi^ {\dagger} \partial_ {\nu} \Phi + i \bar {\Psi} \gamma^ {\mu} \partial_ {\mu} \Psi + \lambda \left(\Phi^ {\dagger} \Phi - \frac {f ^ {2}}{2}\right) ^ {2} \right. \\ \left. + g _ {\mathrm {f}} \bar {\Psi} _ {\mathrm {L}} \Phi \Psi_ {\mathrm {R}} + g _ {\mathrm {f}} \bar {\Psi} _ {\mathrm {R}} \Phi^ {\dagger} \Psi_ {\mathrm {L}} \right], \tag {5.80} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\Phi$  is a complex scalar field,  $\Psi$  a Dirac spinor and  $\Psi_{\mathrm{LR}} = (1\pm \gamma_5) / 2\Psi$ . The quantity  $f$  is the energy scale at which the symmetry is spontaneously broken,  $\lambda$  is a dimensionless coupling constant and  $g_{\mathrm{f}}$  a dimensionless Yukawa coupling. This action is invariant under the U(1) transformation:  $\Phi \rightarrow e^{i\alpha}\Phi$ ,  $\Psi_{\mathrm{L}}\rightarrow e^{i\alpha /2}\Psi_{\mathrm{L}}$  and  $\Psi_{\mathrm{R}}\rightarrow e^{-i\alpha /2}\Psi_{\mathrm{R}}$ , where  $\alpha$  is an arbitrary constant. Due to the "Mexican hat" potential for the scalar field, this symmetry is spontaneously broken below the scale  $f$  and the scalar field acquires the  $vev\langle \Phi \rangle = f / \sqrt{2} e^{i\phi /f}$ . The field  $\phi$  corresponds to an "angular variable" and is a Goldstone boson. Below the scale of broken symmetry, the effective Lagrangian can be expressed as

$$
\mathcal {L} = \frac {1}{2} \partial_ {\mu} \phi \partial^ {\mu} \phi + i \bar {\Psi} \gamma^ {\mu} \partial_ {\mu} \Psi + g _ {\mathrm {f}} \frac {f}{\sqrt {2}} \left(\bar {\Psi} _ {\mathrm {L}} \Psi_ {\mathrm {R}} e ^ {i \phi / f} + \bar {\Psi} _ {\mathrm {R}} \Psi_ {\mathrm {L}} e ^ {- i \phi / f}\right). (5. 8 1)
$$

It is now invariant under  $\phi \rightarrow \phi + 2\pi f$ ,  $\Psi_{\mathrm{L}} \rightarrow e^{i\alpha /2}\Psi_{\mathrm{L}}$  and  $\Psi_{\mathrm{R}} \rightarrow e^{-i\alpha /2}\Psi_{\mathrm{R}}$ . Then, we assume that an explicit symmetry breaking takes place, for instance through the appearance of a fermion condensate for which  $\langle \bar{\Psi}\Psi \rangle \simeq M_{\mathrm{s}}^3$  where  $M_{\mathrm{s}} < f$  is the scale at which this symmetry breaking occurs. As a consequence, the effective Lagrangian takes the form

$$
\mathcal {L} = \frac {1}{2} \partial_ {\mu} \phi \partial^ {\mu} \phi + 2 g _ {\mathrm {f}} M _ {\mathrm {s}} ^ {3} \frac {f}{\sqrt {2}} \cos \left(\frac {\phi}{f}\right). \tag {5.82}
$$

We see that the Nambu-Goldstone boson has acquired a cosine potential and the overall scale of the potential is given by  $M^4 \simeq g_{\mathrm{f}}M_{\mathrm{s}}^3 f$ . Therefore, if one takes  $f \simeq M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ ,  $M_{\mathrm{s}}$  slightly below the GUT scale and a Yukawa coupling of order one, one can "naturally" generate a small ratio  $M / f$ . A last remark is in order on this model. Suppose that quantum gravity effects generate non-renormalizable higher order terms in the action (5.80) like

$$
\Delta V = a _ {m n} \frac {\left| \Phi \right| ^ {2 m}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2 m + n - 4}} \left(\Phi^ {n} + \Phi^ {\dagger n}\right), \tag {5.83}
$$

where  $a_{mn}$  are a priori unknown coefficients. After symmetry breaking, one would therefore obtain a correction of the form

$$
\Delta V = a _ {m n} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4} \left(\frac {f}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2 m + n} \cos \left(n \frac {\phi}{f}\right). \tag {5.84}
$$

If  $f \gtrsim M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , as favored by current cosmological data (see below) these terms should dominate unless the coefficients  $a_{mn}$  are fine-tuned to very small values. Notice that the overall scale of the potential is now given by  $a_{mn}M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^4$ , which also demands that  $a_{mn} \lesssim 10^{-15}$  in order to have the correct CMB normalization. These terms are therefore dangerous for the consistency and the natural character of the model. This model has been studied in more details in Refs. [315-329].

Many other types of candidates have subsequently been explored in order to produce scenarios similar to that of Natural Inflation. For example, in Ref. [330], it was suggested to use a pseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson as the rolling field in double field inflation. Then, NI potentials generated by radiative corrections in models with explicitly broken Abelian [331] and non-Abelian [332, 333] symmetries were considered, showing that NI models with  $f \simeq M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  and  $f \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  can both be generated. In Refs. [334], the field  $\phi$  is considered to be a Polonyi field [335] and the model predicts that  $f = M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ . Refs. [336, 337] have examined natural inflation in the context of extra dimensions and Ref. [338] has used pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons from little Higgs models to drive hybrid inflation. Also, Refs. [339, 340] have used the natural inflation idea of pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons in the context of braneworld scenarios to drive inflation, Ref. [341] has studied the model in 5- $D$  warped backgrounds. The same potential has also been obtained and studied in Ref. [342] when studying instantons in non-linear sigma models, and in Ref. [343] as providing quintessential inflation. In some of these references the potential is sometimes found with the minus sign in front of the cosine term, which is, up to a shift in the field  $vev \phi / f \rightarrow \phi / f + \pi$ , the same potential as already studied before. This last model has also been derived and studied in Refs. [336, 337, 344] in the context of orbifold GUT inflation, where the potential is given by

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ F \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) + F \left(2 \frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) + \frac {F (0)}{2} \right], \tag {5.85}
$$

with

$$
F (x) = - \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {\cos (n \pi x)}{n ^ {5}}. \tag {5.86}
$$

This potential must be studied in its increasing branch, and in the small field limit. At leading order, one recovers the cosine potential.

Finally, an important question is whether a situation where  $f > M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  makes sense from the high energy physics and effective field theory point of view. In fact, it was shown in Refs. [345-347] that  $f \lesssim 10^{12} \mathrm{GeV}$  in order for the corresponding energy density not to exceed the critical energy density. But this constraint applies to the post inflationary Universe and, during inflation, Ref. [348] has argued that it is not relevant. However, it remains the question of whether  $f > M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  makes sense or not. To address this issue, an interesting mechanism has been proposed in Ref. [349] (see also Ref. [350]) which shows that two axion fields at sub-Planckian scales can have an effective dynamics similar to the one field Natural Inflation model with  $f > M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ .

Let us consider a model with two axions,  $\theta$  and  $\rho$  the effective Lagrangian of which is given by

$$
\mathcal {L} = \frac {1}{2} \partial_ {\mu} \theta \partial^ {\mu} \theta + \frac {1}{2} \partial_ {\mu} \rho \partial^ {\mu} \rho + M _ {1} ^ {4} \left[ 1 - \cos \left(\frac {\theta}{f} + \frac {\rho}{g _ {1}}\right) \right] + M _ {2} ^ {4} \left[ 1 - \cos \left(\frac {\theta}{f} + \frac {\rho}{g _ {2}}\right) \right], \tag {5.87}
$$

where  $M_{1}$  and  $M_{2}$ ,  $f$ ,  $g_{1}$  and  $g_{2}$  are constant, a priori, arbitrary scales. The same model can be re-written in terms of the fields  $\psi$  and  $\xi$  defined by

$$
\psi = \frac {f g _ {1}}{\sqrt {f ^ {2} + g _ {1} ^ {2}}} \left(\frac {\theta}{f} + \frac {\rho}{g _ {1}}\right), \quad \xi = \frac {f g _ {1}}{\sqrt {f ^ {2} + g _ {1} ^ {2}}} \left(- \frac {\theta}{g _ {1}} + \frac {\rho}{f}\right). \tag {5.88}
$$

It is easy to show that this leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {L} = \frac {1}{2} \partial_ {\mu} \psi \partial^ {\mu} \psi + \frac {1}{2} \partial_ {\mu} \xi \partial^ {\mu} \xi + M _ {1} ^ {4} \left[ 1 - \cos \left(\frac {\sqrt {f ^ {2} + g _ {1} ^ {2}}}{f g _ {1}} \psi\right) \right] \\ + M _ {2} ^ {4} \left[ 1 - \cos \left(\frac {f ^ {2} + g _ {1} g _ {2}}{f g _ {2} \sqrt {f ^ {2} + g _ {1} ^ {2}}} \psi + \frac {g _ {1} - g _ {2}}{g _ {2} \sqrt {f ^ {2} + g _ {1} ^ {2}}} \xi\right) \right]. \tag {5.89} \\ \end{array}
$$

Moreover, the mass of the two fields  $\psi$  and  $\xi$  can be expressed as

$$
m _ {\psi} ^ {2} = \left(\frac {1}{f ^ {2}} + \frac {1}{g _ {1} ^ {2}}\right) M _ {1} ^ {4}, \quad m _ {\xi} ^ {2} = \frac {\left(g _ {1} - g _ {2}\right) ^ {2}}{g _ {2} ^ {2} \left(f ^ {2} + g _ {1} ^ {2}\right)} M _ {2} ^ {4}. \tag {5.90}
$$

If  $g_{1}$  is very close to  $g_{2}$ , then the field  $\xi$  will be light and, therefore, will have a non-trivial dynamics. In addition, if the field  $\psi$  is sufficiently heavy (compared to the Hubble parameter), then its vev will be frozen at  $\psi = 0$ . In this case, we see that the original two fields model effectively reduces to a one field NI model with a scale  $f_{\xi}$  given by

$$
f _ {\xi} = \frac {g _ {2} \sqrt {f ^ {2} + g _ {1} ^ {2}}}{g _ {1} - g _ {2}}. \tag {5.91}
$$

But, since,  $g_{1}$  is close to  $g_{2}$ , the scale  $f_{\xi}$  will be large even if the fundamental scales  $f$ ,  $g_{1}$  and/or  $g_{2}$  are sub-Planckian. In this way, one can generate super-Planckian values for the scale  $f$  and, at the same time, have a theory which can be consistent from the effective field theory point of view.

# Slow-Roll Analysis

Summarizing the above discussion, the model that we consider in this section makes use of a potential that can be written as

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ 1 + \cos \left(\frac {\phi}{f}\right) \right]. \tag {5.92}
$$

The scale  $M$  is determined by the CMB normalization and the potential depends on one parameter: the a priori unknown scale  $f$ . The potential of Eq. (5.92) is displayed with its logarithm in Fig. 15. Since it is a periodic and even function of the field  $v e v \phi$ , it is enough to study it in the range  $\phi \in [0, \pi f]$  where inflation proceeds from the left to the right. If one lets  $x \equiv \phi / f$ , the slow-roll parameters can be expressed as

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{2 f ^ {2}} \frac {\sin^ {2} x}{(1 + \cos x) ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \frac {2 M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{f ^ {2}} \frac {1}{1 + \cos x}, \quad \epsilon_ {3} = 2 \epsilon_ {1}. \tag {5.93}
$$

They are displayed in Fig. 15, where one can see that they are all increasing functions of the field  $vev$ , which means that they all increase during inflation. Inflation stops at the position  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  given by  $\epsilon_1 = 1$  (see below), and one can see that  $\epsilon_2$  and  $\epsilon_3$  are already greater than one at this point. This means that the slow-roll approximation stops being valid slightly before the end of inflation, and the few last  $e$ -folds may not be properly described in this frame of approximations. Another remark to be made is the fact that one generically has

$$
\epsilon_ {2} > \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{f ^ {2}}. \tag {5.94}
$$

This means that in order for the slow-roll approximation to be valid, one must require  $f / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \gg 1$  which is not necessarily problematic from a high energy physics point of view (see the above discussion).

The end of inflation occurs when  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$ , i.e. at a position given by

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} = \arccos  \left(\frac {1 - 2 f ^ {2} / M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{1 + 2 f ^ {2} / M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}\right). \tag {5.95}
$$

From this expression, one can calculate the value of the other slow roll parameters at the end of inflation, namely  $\epsilon_2^{\mathrm{end}} = 2 + M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 /f^2$  and  $\epsilon_3^{\mathrm{end}} = 2\epsilon_2^{\mathrm{end}}$ , which confirms that the last few  $e$ -folds may not be described properly in the slow-roll approximation.

Let us now calculate the slow-roll trajectory. It is given by

$$
N _ {\text {e n d}} - N = \frac {f ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \ln \left(\frac {1 - \cos x _ {\text {e n d}}}{1 - \cos x}\right), \tag {5.96}
$$

where  $N_{\mathrm{end}}$  is the number of  $e$ -folds at the end of inflation, and  $N$  is the number of  $e$ -folds at some point when the scaled field  $vev$  is  $x$ . This trajectory can be inverted and one obtains

$$
x = \arccos  \left\{1 - (1 - \cos x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}) \exp \left[ - \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{f ^ {2}} (N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N) \right] \right\}. \tag {5.97}
$$

Replacing  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  by its value [see Eq. (5.95)] gives

$$
x = \arccos  \left\{1 - \frac {4 f ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} + 2 f ^ {2}} \exp \left[ - \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{f ^ {2}} (N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N) \right] \right\}. \tag {5.98}
$$

Finally, the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies fixes the parameter  $M$  to

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{f ^ {2}} \frac {\sin^ {2} x _ {*}}{\left(1 + \cos x _ {*}\right) ^ {3}}. \tag {5.99}
$$

If  $f / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} = \mathcal{O}(1)$ , this expression simplifies to

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} \simeq 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}} \frac {e ^ {- 2 M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} / f ^ {2} \Delta N _ {*}}}{1 + 2 f ^ {2} / M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}, \tag {5.100}
$$

which gives rise to  $M / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-13}$ . On the contrary, if  $f / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \gg 1$  one has

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} \simeq 3 6 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}} \left(\frac {f}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}}, \tag {5.101}
$$

and the potential energy scale goes up. For instance, if  $f / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} = 10^{2}$  one has  $M / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-2}$ .

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the natural inflation models are displayed in Fig. 132. The reheating equation of state parameter  $\overline{w}_{\mathrm{reh}}$  has been taken to 0 since the potential is quadratic close to its minimum. In the limit  $f / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \to \infty$ , the quadratic model predictions (LFI with  $p = 2$ , see section 5.2) seem to be recovered. Indeed, from the above formula, one can check that in this limit both  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  and  $x_*$  approach  $\pi$  and the potential is, at leading order, a parabola. More precisely, one can check from Eq. (5.98) that in the limit  $f / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \to \infty$ , one has  $\cos x_* \simeq -1 + (1 + 2\Delta N_*) M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 / f^2$ , from which one deduces that  $\epsilon_{1*} \simeq 1 / (1 + 2\Delta N_*)$  and  $\epsilon_{2*} \simeq 2 / (1 + 2\Delta N_*) \simeq 2\epsilon_{1*}$ . These relations are characteristic of the LFI quadratic models, see Eq. (5.42). However, one has  $\epsilon_{3*} = 2\epsilon_{2*}$  which differs from the LFI quadratic relationship  $\epsilon_{3*} = \epsilon_{2*}$ , and therefore quantities sensitive to  $\epsilon_3$ , such as the running  $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ , would break the degeneracy between NI and the LFI quadratic model. As expected, large values of  $f / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  seem to be favored by the data (as well as high reheating temperatures), and in practice,  $f / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} < 4$  appears to be disfavored at the  $2\sigma$  level by the Planck 2018 + Bicep-Keck data.
