# Orientifold Inflation (OI)

# Theoretical Justifications

The model is based on the following considerations. Let us start with a  $N = 1$  supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theory the Lagrangian of which can be written as

$$
\mathcal {L} = - \frac {1}{4} F _ {\mu \nu} ^ {a} F ^ {a \mu \nu} + \frac {i}{2} \bar {\lambda} ^ {a} \not D _ {a b} \lambda^ {b}, \tag {6.229}
$$

with  $a = 1, \dots, N_{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$ ,  $N_{\mathrm{c}}$  being the number characterizing the group  $\mathrm{SU}(N_{\mathrm{c}})$ .  $F_{\mu \nu}^{a}$  is the field strength,  $\lambda^a$  a spinor field and  $\not D$  a covariant derivative. A is a composite scalar field, i.e. a bound state denoted by  $\varphi \simeq \lambda \bar{\lambda}$ , can actually appear in the theory if a strongly interacting regime takes place. The effective Lagrangian aimed at describing its dynamics has been derived in Ref. [597] and reads

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {Y V}} = - \frac {N _ {\mathrm {c}} ^ {2}}{\alpha_ {\mathrm {O I}}} \left(\varphi \varphi^ {\dagger}\right) ^ {- 2 / 3} \partial_ {\mu} \varphi \partial^ {\mu} \varphi^ {\dagger} - \frac {4 \alpha_ {\mathrm {O I}} N _ {\mathrm {c}} ^ {2}}{9} \left(\varphi \varphi^ {\dagger}\right) ^ {2 / 3} \ln \left(\frac {\varphi}{\Lambda^ {3}}\right) \ln \left(\frac {\varphi^ {\dagger}}{\Lambda^ {3}}\right), (6. 2 3 0)
$$

where  $\alpha_{\mathrm{OI}}$  is a constant and  $\Lambda$  a mass scale. This class of theories are discussed in more detail in section 7.5. However, in Ref. [598], it was argued that in "orientifold theories", the above Lagrangian can be slightly deformed and now takes the form

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {O I}} = - \frac {N _ {\mathrm {c}} ^ {2}}{\alpha_ {\mathrm {O I}}} \left(\varphi \varphi^ {\dagger}\right) ^ {- 2 / 3} \partial_ {\mu} \varphi \partial^ {\mu} \varphi^ {\dagger} - \frac {4 \alpha_ {\mathrm {O I}} N _ {\mathrm {c}} ^ {2}}{9} \left(\varphi \varphi^ {\dagger}\right) ^ {2 / 3} \left[ \ln \left(\frac {\varphi}{\Lambda^ {3}}\right) \ln \left(\frac {\varphi^ {\dagger}}{\Lambda^ {3}}\right) - \beta \right], (6. 2 3 1)
$$

where  $\beta = \mathcal{O}(1 / N_{\mathrm{c}})$ . Ref. [598] raised the possibility that  $\varphi$  (or, rather, its canonically conjugated version) could be the inflaton. In fact, in order to study this question, one must also specify the gravitational coupling. In Ref. [598], the scalar field  $\varphi$  is non-minimally coupled to gravity such that, in the Jordan frame,

$$
S = \int \mathrm {d} ^ {4} x \sqrt {- g} \left[ - \frac {M ^ {2} + N _ {\mathrm {c}} ^ {2} \xi (\varphi \varphi^ {\dagger}) ^ {1 / 3}}{2} R + \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {O I}} \right], \tag {6.232}
$$

where  $M$  is a mass scale. There is a new parameter in the problem,  $\xi$ , which describes the strength of the non-minimal coupling to gravity (as it was the case for Higgs inflation, see section 4.2). Then, in the Einstein frame, one can write the above model as Ref. [598]

$$
\begin{array}{l} S = \int \mathrm {d} ^ {4} x \sqrt {- g} \Biggl \{- \frac {1}{2} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} R - \frac {N _ {\mathrm {c}} ^ {2}}{\alpha_ {\mathrm {O I}}} \Omega^ {- 2} \left[ 1 + \frac {\alpha_ {\mathrm {O I}} N _ {\mathrm {c}} ^ {2} \xi^ {2}}{3 M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \Omega^ {- 2} (\varphi \varphi^ {\dagger}) ^ {1 / 3} \right] (\varphi \varphi^ {\dagger}) ^ {- 2 / 3} \partial_ {\mu} \varphi \partial^ {\mu} \varphi^ {\dagger} \\ \left. - \Omega^ {- 4} V _ {\mathrm {O I}} \right\}. \tag {6.233} \\ \end{array}
$$

In this expression,  $V_{\mathrm{OI}}$  refers to the second term in Eq. (6.231) and

$$
\Omega^ {2} \equiv \frac {M ^ {2} + N _ {\mathrm {c}} ^ {2} \xi (\varphi \varphi^ {\dagger}) ^ {1 / 3}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}. \tag {6.234}
$$

In the following, we consider two situations: the case where  $\xi \neq 0$  such that  $\Omega^2 \simeq N_c^2\xi \varphi^{2/3} / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2$ , i.e. the second term in the definition of  $\Omega^2$  dominates (the large field limit) and the case  $\xi = 0$ . In the first case, taking  $\varphi = \varphi^\dagger$  and canonically normalizing the field one finds

$$
V (\varphi) = \frac {4 \alpha_ {\mathrm {O I}} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}}{9 N _ {\mathrm {c}} ^ {2} \xi^ {2}} \left[ \left(\ln \frac {\varphi}{\Lambda^ {3}}\right) ^ {2} - \beta \right]. (6. 2 3 5)
$$

The canonically normalized field is  $\phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \propto \ln \varphi$ . Since  $\beta$  is a small number, it can be neglected and this model is in fact a LFI model with  $V(\phi) \propto \phi^2$  which was already studied in section 5.2. For the second case, it is sufficient to restart from Eq. (6.231). Then, the canonically normalized field reads

$$
\frac {\varphi}{\Lambda^ {3}} = \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {3}, (6. 2 3 6)
$$

with

$$
\phi_ {0} = 3 N _ {\mathrm {c}} \left(\frac {2}{\alpha_ {\mathrm {O I}}}\right) ^ {1 / 3} \Lambda . \tag {6.237}
$$

It follows that the potential can be written as

$$
V = \alpha_ {\mathrm {O I}} N _ {\mathrm {c}} ^ {2} \Lambda^ {4} \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {4} \left[ \ln^ {2} \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) - \frac {\beta}{9} \right]. \tag {6.238}
$$

This model is studied in detail in the next subsection. The case  $\beta = 0$  will also be investigated in section 7.5.

# Slow-Roll Analysis

We now turn to the slow-roll study of the potential derived previously in Eq. (6.238). This one can be re-written as

$$
V \left(\phi\right) = M ^ {4} \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {4} \left[ \left(\ln \frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} - \alpha \right], \tag {6.239}
$$

where we have defined

$$
M ^ {4} = \alpha_ {\mathrm {O I}} N _ {\mathrm {c}} ^ {2} \Lambda^ {4}, \quad \alpha \equiv \frac {\beta}{9}. \tag {6.240}
$$

One should be careful that  $\alpha_{\mathrm{OI}}$  appearing in the first of the two above equations stems from the Lagrangian used in the previous subsection while the observable constant  $\alpha$  only refers to the quantity  $\beta / 9 = \mathcal{O}(1 / N_{\mathrm{c}}) \ll 1$ . The scale  $\phi_0$  is defined in Eq. (6.237) and will be chosen such that  $\phi_0 \simeq 10^{16} \mathrm{GeV}$ . The potential as well as its logarithm are displayed in Fig. 76.

Defining the quantity  $x$  by the following expression

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}, \tag {6.241}
$$

the potential remains positive provided  $x < x_{V = 0}^{-}$  or  $x > x_{V = 0}^{+}$ , where

$$
x _ {V = 0} ^ {\pm} = e ^ {\pm \sqrt {\alpha}}. \tag {6.242}
$$

It vanishes at  $x = 0$ , then increases to reach a local maximum at  $x_{V' = 0}^{-}$ , decreases again to become negative at  $x_{V = 0}^{-}$ , reaches a local minimum at  $x_{V' = 0}^{+}$ , then increases again to become positive at  $x_{V = 0}^{+}$  and diverges asymptotically. The values of  $x_{V' = 0}^{-}$  and  $x_{V' = 0}^{+}$  are given by

$$
x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {\pm} = e ^ {- \frac {1}{4} \pm \sqrt {\frac {1}{1 6} + \alpha}}. \tag {6.243}
$$

A priori three regimes of inflation may exist:  $x < x_{V' = 0}^{-}$  and inflation proceeds from the right to the left,  $x_{V' = 0}^{-} < x < x_{V = 0}^{-}$  and inflation proceeds from the left to the right,  $x_{V = 0}^{+} < x$  and inflation proceeds from the right to the left in the direction specified by the arrow in Fig. 76. As explained below, only the third possibility allows us to have a slow-roll inflationary regime.

Let us now calculate the quantities  $\epsilon_{n}$ . The first three Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = 2 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \left(\frac {2 \ln^ {2} x + \ln x - 2 \alpha}{x \ln^ {2} x - \alpha x}\right) ^ {2}, \tag {6.244}
$$

$$
\epsilon_ {2} = 4 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {2 \ln^ {4} x + \ln^ {3} x + (1 - 4 \alpha) \ln^ {2} x - \alpha \ln x + \alpha + 2 \alpha^ {2}}{(x \ln^ {2} x - \alpha x) ^ {2}}, \tag {6.245}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \epsilon_ {3} = 2 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \left[ 8 \alpha^ {4} + 6 \alpha^ {3} - \alpha^ {2} (8 \alpha + 1 5) \ln x + 2 \alpha (3 - 1 6 \alpha^ {2} - 2 \alpha) \ln^ {2} x \right. \\ + 8 \alpha (3 \alpha + 1) \ln^ {3} x + 2 (2 4 \alpha^ {2} - 5 \alpha + 1) \ln^ {4} x + (7 - 2 4 \alpha) \ln^ {5} x + 8 (1 - 4 \alpha) \ln^ {6} x \tag {6.246} \\ \left. + 8 \ln^ {7} x + 8 \ln^ {8} x \right] \left(x \ln^ {2} x - \alpha x\right) ^ {- 2} \\ \times \left[ 2 \alpha^ {2} + \alpha - \alpha \ln x + (1 - 4 \alpha) \ln^ {2} x + \ln^ {3} x + 2 \ln^ {4} x \right] ^ {- 1}. \\ \end{array}
$$

They have been represented in Fig. 76. One can see that the slow-roll regime can only take place in the  $x > x_{V=0}^{+}$  region, where  $\epsilon_{1}$  continuously increase as inflation proceeds from the right to the left, and diverges at  $x_{V=0}^{+}$ . In the other domains,  $\epsilon_{2}$  remains too large to support slow-roll inflation. Within the  $x > x_{V=0}^{+}$  domain, inflation naturally ends by slow-roll violation, but the field value  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  at which this occurs has to be determined numerically. However, since  $\phi_{0} \simeq 10^{16} \mathrm{GeV}$ , one can derive an approximated formula for  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  in the

$\phi_0 \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  limit, namely

$$
x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} \simeq 2 \sqrt {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}. \tag {6.247}
$$

The next step is to derive the slow-roll trajectory. It can be obtained from Eq. (3.11) and reads

$$
\begin{array}{l} N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = - \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \bigg \{\frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} - x ^ {2}}{8} + \frac {\ln^ {2} (x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {+}) - \alpha}{2 \sqrt {1 + 1 6 \alpha}} (x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {+}) ^ {2} \left[ \mathrm {E i} (2 \ln \frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {+}}) \right] \\ \left. - \operatorname {E i} \left(2 \ln \frac {x}{x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {+}}\right) \right] - \frac {\ln^ {2} \left(x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {-}\right) - \alpha}{2 \sqrt {1 + 1 6 \alpha}} \left(x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {-}\right) ^ {2} \left[ \operatorname {E i} \left(2 \ln \frac {x _ {\text {e n d}}}{x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {-}}\right) - \operatorname {E i} \left(2 \ln \frac {x}{x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {-}}\right) \right] \Bigg \}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\mathrm{Ei}$  is the exponential integral function, and where  $x_{V^{\prime} = 0}^{\pm}$  have been defined in Eq. (6.243). In the  $\phi_0\ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  limit, this trajectory reduces to  $\Delta N_{*}\simeq \phi_{0}^{2} / (8M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{2})(x_{*}^{2} - x_{\mathrm{end}}^{2})$  , where we have introduced the observable field value  $x_{*}$  at which the pivot scale crossed the Hubble radius during inflation. It can be inverted to give  $x_{*}$  in terms of  $\Delta N_{*} = N_{\mathrm{end}} - N_{*}$  and one gets

$$
x _ {*} \simeq 2 \sqrt {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}} \sqrt {\Delta N _ {*} + 1}. \tag {6.249}
$$

Plugging this into Eqs. (6.244), (6.245) and (6.246) gives the approximated expressions

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \simeq \epsilon_ {2 *} \simeq \epsilon_ {3 *} \simeq \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*} + 1}, \tag {6.250}
$$

hence

$$
r \simeq \frac {1 6}{\Delta N _ {*} + 1}, \qquad n _ {\mathrm {S}} - 1 \simeq - \frac {3}{\Delta N _ {*} + 1}, \qquad \alpha_ {\mathrm {S}} \simeq - \frac {3}{(\Delta N _ {*} + 1) ^ {2}}. \qquad (6. 2 5 1)
$$

From  $x_{*}$ , the parameter  $M$  is fixed by the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies and one obtains

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = \frac {2 8 8 0 \pi^ {2} \left(2 \ln^ {2} x _ {*} + \ln x _ {*} - 2 \alpha\right) ^ {2}}{x _ {*} ^ {6} \left(\ln^ {2} x _ {*} - \alpha\right) ^ {3}} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.252}
$$

In the  $\phi_0\ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  limit, the previous expression reduces to the following formula

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} \simeq \frac {4 5 \pi^ {2}}{2 (\Delta N _ {*} + 1) ^ {3}} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} \frac {1}{\ln^ {2} \left(2 \sqrt {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}} \sqrt {\Delta N _ {*} + 1}\right)} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.253}
$$

With  $\phi_0\simeq 10^{16}\mathrm{GeV}$ , this typically gives  $M / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\simeq 5\times 10^{-4}$ .

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the orientifold inflation models are displayed in Fig. 223, for  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} = 10^{-4}, 10^{-2}$ , and 1. Let us recall that natural values are around  $\phi_0 \simeq 10^{16} \mathrm{GeV}$  and  $\alpha \in [10^{-3}, 1]$ . The reheating equation of state parameter has been fixed to  $\overline{w}_{\mathrm{reh}} = 0$  since the potential is quadratic in the vicinity of its minimum. According to the rough picture provided by Eq. (6.250), the predictions of these models almost do not depend on its parameters  $\phi_0$  and  $\alpha$ , which is why all the points in Fig. 223 are superimposed. In particular, one can see that these models generically predict an important amount of gravitational waves which is disfavored by the observations.
