# Power Law Inflation (PLI)

These models refer to inflationary potentials of the form

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} e ^ {- \alpha \phi / M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}, \tag {5.110}
$$

where  $\alpha$  is a dimensionless parameter. They have been intensively studied since they lead to an exact inflationary dynamics, of the power law form, hence their name. Moreover, the power spectrum can also be determined exactly in this case. The background solution reads  $a\propto (t / t_0)^{2 / \alpha^2}$  and  $\phi = \phi_0 + 2M_{\mathrm{Pl}} / \alpha \ln (t / t_0)$  with  $t_0^2 = 2M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 /\left(\alpha^2 M^4\right)(6 / \alpha^2 -1)e^{\alpha \phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}}$ . We see that we have inflation provided  $\alpha \in [0,\sqrt{2} ]$ .

This scenario was introduced in Ref. [356, 357] where the two point correlation function of the cosmological fluctuations was calculated for the first time (see also Refs. [358, 359]).

The predictions of this model were recently compared to the Planck data in Ref. [360]. Soon after Ref. [357], it was also considered in Refs. [361, 362] but in the context of quintessence, i.e. for models of dark energy in which the energy density of the scalar field redshifts as a power law of the scale factor  $\rho \propto a^{-q}$ . In that case, one has  $\alpha = \sqrt{q / 2}$ . The same potential also arises in the case where large field inflation is considered (LFI, see section 5.2) but with a non-minimal coupling of the inflaton to the gravity sector, see Refs. [363, 364] (the exponential potential appears after the transformation to the Einstein frame). In Ref. [365], a cosmic no-hair theorem for Bianchi models was proven assuming that the potential of the inflaton is of the same type as in Eq. (5.110). It was shown that one must have  $0 < \alpha < \sqrt{2 / 3}$  so that the isotropic power law solution is the unique attractor for any initially expanding Bianchi type model (except type IX). In Ref. [366], the potential (5.110) has been studied in the Kantowski-Sachs metric, and it was found that the production of particles by the scalar field acts as viscous forces which enlarges the range of initial conditions leading to successful inflation. In Ref. [367], the nature of the potential  $V(\phi)$  relevant to having inflation in presence of a minimally coupled scalar field together with a causal viscous fluid was investigated. It was shown that this leads to an exponential potential. In Refs. [368-370], the exponential potential was used to describe the dynamics of a tachyonic matter field (i.e. with a non-minimal kinetic term). In Ref. [371], the general transformations that leave

unchanged the form of the field equations for Bianchi V cosmologies were investigated, and it was found that they admit asymptotic stable points that lead to power law solutions of the type (5.110). In Ref. [372], inflation was studied in the context of M-theory on  $S^1 / \mathbb{Z}_2$  via the non-perturbative dynamics of M5-branes. The open membrane instanton interactions between the branes give rise to potentials of the type (5.110). Within the same framework, Ref. [373] has discussed a realization of cascade inflation as assisted inflation built upon a succession of power law inflationary eras. Ref. [374] has used the exponential potential (5.110) in the context of Randall-Sandrum type II Braneworld model. Finally, the general dynamics of power law inflation was studied in detail in Refs. [356, 375-383], where various aspects of its phenomenology were highlighted.

The potential and its logarithm are displayed in Fig. 18. They are decreasing functions of the field, hence inflation proceeds from the left to the right. The slow-roll parameters take a simple form given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {\alpha^ {2}}{2}, \quad \epsilon_ {i > 1} = 0. \tag {5.111}
$$

Since the first slow-roll parameter is constant, inflation cannot stop by slow-roll violation and one has to assume that, at some  $vev \phi_{\mathrm{end}}$ , a tachyonic instability is triggered. A priori, this means that the model has in fact an additional new free parameter. However, because the slow-roll parameters do not depend on  $\phi$ , as well as all the other properties of the inflationary dynamics (even when the slow-roll approximation is not satisfied, see below), the observational predictions of the model cannot depend on  $\phi_{\mathrm{end}}$  and this parameter turns out to be irrelevant.

The Hubble flow hierarchy being almost trivial, the exact dynamics of the model can be worked out even if the slow-roll approximation is violated. Indeed, let us first notice that the slow-roll trajectory can be explicitly integrated, and gives

$$
\frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} = \frac {\phi_ {\text {e n d}}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} + \alpha (N - N _ {\text {e n d}}). \tag {5.112}
$$

Then, one can remark that this trajectory is also a solution of the exact Klein-Gordon equation of motion, which reads in terms of the number of  $e$ -folds  $N$ ,

$$
H ^ {2} \frac {\partial^ {2} \phi}{\partial N ^ {2}} + \left(3 H ^ {2} + H \partial \frac {\partial H}{\partial N}\right) \frac {\partial \phi}{\partial N} + \frac {\mathrm {d} V}{\mathrm {d} \phi} = 0. \tag {5.113}
$$

Indeed, the first term vanishes, and the second term requires

$$
H ^ {2} = \frac {V + \dot {\phi} ^ {2} / 2}{3 M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} = \frac {V + \frac {H ^ {2}}{2} \left(\frac {\partial \phi}{\partial N}\right) ^ {2}}{3 M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} = \frac {V + \frac {H ^ {2}}{2} \alpha^ {2} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{3 M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}, \tag {5.114}
$$

from which one gets

$$
H ^ {2} = \frac {V}{3 M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \frac {1}{1 - \alpha^ {2} / 6}. \tag {5.115}
$$

From there, one can evaluate all terms in the Klein-Gordon equation, and verify that Eq. (5.112) is indeed a solution of Eq. (5.113). Since it is a second order differential equation, other solutions exist, but it can be shown [361, 362] that the exact solution is an attractor. Let us also notice that combining Eq. (5.115) with Eq. (5.112) gives rise to

$$
H = H _ {\text {e n d}} \left(\frac {a _ {\text {e n d}}}{a}\right) ^ {\alpha^ {2} / 2}, \tag {5.116}
$$

which can be integrated and gives

$$
a (t) = a _ {\text {e n d}} \left(\frac {t}{t _ {\text {e n d}}}\right) ^ {2 / \alpha^ {2}}. \tag {5.117}
$$

One recovers the solution mentioned at the beginning of this section. Finally, the equation of state  $w = P / \rho$  can also be worked out exactly and one gets

$$
w = - 1 + \frac {\alpha^ {2}}{3}. \tag {5.118}
$$

Again, all the previous expressions are valid even if the slow-roll approximation is not satisfied. One can see that pure de Sitter corresponds to  $\alpha = 0$ . In this case the potential is constant, the equation of state is  $-1$  and the scale factor expands exponentially.

Another nice feature of power-law inflation is that the spectrum of the perturbations can be computed exactly without relying on any approximation. Defining the parameter  $\beta \leq -2$  from  $\alpha^2 / 2 = (\beta + 2) / (\beta + 1)$ , the primordial scalar power spectrum is given by

$$
\mathcal {P} _ {\zeta} = \frac {H _ {*} ^ {2}}{\pi \epsilon_ {1} (8 \pi M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2})} f (\beta) \left(\frac {k}{k _ {*}}\right) ^ {2 \beta + 4}, \tag {5.119}
$$

where

$$
f (\beta) \equiv \frac {1}{\pi} \left[ \frac {(1 + \beta) ^ {1 + \beta}}{2 ^ {1 + \beta}} \Gamma \left(\frac {1}{2} + \beta\right) \right] ^ {2}. \tag {5.120}
$$

In particular,  $f(\beta = -2) = 1$ . The power spectrum of gravitational waves can also be obtained remarking that we have  $\mu_{\mathrm{S}} = \mu_{\mathrm{T}}$  for power law inflation. From

$$
\mathcal {P} _ {\zeta} = \frac {k ^ {3}}{8 \pi^ {2}} \left| \frac {\mu_ {\mathrm {S}}}{a \sqrt {\epsilon_ {1}}} \right| ^ {2}, \quad \mathcal {P} _ {h} = \frac {2 k ^ {3}}{\pi^ {2}} \left| \frac {\mu_ {\mathrm {T}}}{a} \right| ^ {2}, \tag {5.121}
$$

one gets

$$
r \equiv \frac {\mathcal {P} _ {h}}{\mathcal {P} _ {\zeta}} = 1 6 \epsilon_ {1} = \frac {1 6 n _ {\mathrm {T}}}{n _ {\mathrm {T}} - 2}, \tag {5.122}
$$

since  $n_{\mathrm{T}} = n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 = 2\beta +4$

Finally, the overall amplitude of the CMB anisotropies leads to a determination of the scale  $M$ , namely

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} \alpha^ {2} e ^ {\alpha \phi_ {*} / M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.123}
$$

Obviously, this normalization depends on the value of  $\phi_{\mathrm{end}}$ , and it is more relevant to express it in terms of the potential energy, say, at the end of inflation:

$$
\frac {V _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} \alpha^ {2} e ^ {- \alpha^ {2} \Delta N _ {*}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}, \tag {5.124}
$$

from which one typically gets  $V_{\mathrm{end}}^{1/4} / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-4}$ .

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the power law inflation models are displayed in Fig. 135. Because the slow-roll parameters are constant during inflation, one can check that the predictions of the models do not depend on the energy scale at which the power law reheating ends. One has  $n_{\mathrm{S}} = 1 - \alpha^{2}$  and  $r = 8\alpha^{2}$ , and from the Planck 2018 + Bicep-Keck constraints, all the models are disfavored at more than two-sigma confidence level.
