# $(R + R^{2p})$  Inflation (RpI)

This model is the Einstein frame description of a scalar-tensor theory equivalent to  $f(R) = R + \epsilon R^{2p} / \mu^{4p - 2}$ , where  $\mu$  is a mass scale,  $\epsilon = \pm 1$ , and  $p > 1/2$  (otherwise the expansion is meaningless). It generalizes the original Starobinsky model [241] obtained for  $p = 1$ . Such theories are quite generic and appear as limiting cases of more general modified gravity theories [245, 440-443] (see Ref. [246] for a review).

Following Refs. [245, 246], one can introduce the scalar degree of freedom  $\phi$  defined by

$$
\frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {g}}} = \sqrt {\frac {3}{2}} \ln \left(| F (R) |\right), \tag {5.188}
$$

where  $F(R) \equiv \partial f / \partial R$ . For the sake of clarify, we identify the Lagrange multiplier field  $\chi$  with its on shell value  $\chi = R$  and drop the "tilde" over Einstein frame quantities, see section 4.1.1 for a detailed discussion of this class of models.

The quantity  $F \equiv \Omega^2$  is also the square of the conformal factor inducing the transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. In the Einstein frame, the field  $\phi$  evolves in a potential given by

$$
V (\phi) = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}}{2} \frac {| F |}{F} \frac {R F - f}{F ^ {2}}. \tag {5.189}
$$

In the present case, one has

$$
F (R) = 1 + 2 \epsilon p \left(\frac {R}{\mu^ {2}}\right) ^ {2 p - 1}, \tag {5.190}
$$

which, for small departures with respect to the Einstein-Hilbert action  $R \ll \mu^2$ , implies that  $F(R) > 0$  as needed. Let us notice that in the opposite situation, accelerated (and super-accelerated) solutions have been shown to exist [246]. Defining the quantity  $y$  by

$$
y \equiv \sqrt {\frac {2}{3}} \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {g}}}, \tag {5.191}
$$

and inserting Eq. (5.190) into Eq. (5.189) one obtains the Einstein frame potential

$$
V = M ^ {4} e ^ {- 2 y} \left| e ^ {y} - 1 \right| ^ {2 p / (2 p - 1)}. \tag {5.192}
$$

The normalization constant  $M^4$  is related to the modified gravity scale  $\mu$  through the following expression

$$
M ^ {4} = \frac {2 p - 1}{4 p} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2} \mu^ {2}}{(2 p) ^ {1 / (2 p - 1)}}. \tag {5.193}
$$

For  $F(R) > 0$ , Eq. (5.188) implies that for  $\epsilon = 1$ , the model is defined in the domain  $y > 0$  whereas for  $\epsilon = -1$  one should consider the domain  $y < 0$  only. Such a potential has also been studied in Ref. [444] for  $p = 1$ , in Refs. [245, 445] for  $p = 4$  and in Ref. [446] for  $p = 2$ . Let us notice that the case  $p = 1$  corresponds to the Higgs inflation potential studied in section 4.2. The case  $p = 1/2$  is singular since one recovers  $f(R) \propto R$ . Taking the limit  $p \to \infty$ , the potential asymptotes  $V \to M^4 e^{-2y} |e^y - 1|$  and varying  $p$  allows us to explore different potential shapes.

Let us first consider the case  $y > 0$  ( $\epsilon = 1$ ). If  $p > 1$ , the potential admits a maximum at

$$
y _ {\max } = \ln \left(\frac {2 p - 1}{p - 1}\right), \tag {5.194}
$$

such that inflation can proceed either for  $0 < y < y_{\max}$  or  $y > y_{\max}$ . We respectively call these regimes RpI1 and RpI2. If  $p < 1$ , the potential is an increasing function of  $y$ , hence inflation proceeds from the right to the left. We call this regime RpI3. The case  $p = 1$  is singular and again, it corresponds to the Higgs inflation potential studied in section 4.2.

The Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation read

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {4}{3} \frac {\left[ 1 + (p - 1) e ^ {y} - 2 p \right] ^ {2}}{(2 p - 1) ^ {2} (e ^ {y} - 1) ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \frac {8}{3} \frac {p e ^ {y}}{(2 p - 1) (e ^ {y} - 1) ^ {2}}, \tag {5.195}
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_ {3} = - \frac {4}{3} \frac {\left(e ^ {y} + 1\right) \left[ 1 + (p - 1) e ^ {y} - 2 p \right]}{\left(2 p - 1\right) \left(e ^ {y} - 1\right) ^ {2}}. \tag {5.196}
$$

The potential and the Hubble flow functions for  $y > 0$  have been represented in Fig. 26. As one can check on these figures, inflation never stops in the RpI2 regime and one needs to complement the model with a mechanism that can end inflation, as for instance with an extra-field and a tachyonic instability. This adds one additional parameter  $y_{\mathrm{end}}$  to the model. When this parameter is large, all the three Hubble flow functions admit asymptotically constant values:

$$
\lim  _ {y \rightarrow \infty} \epsilon_ {1} = \frac {4}{3} \left(\frac {p - 1}{2 p - 1}\right) ^ {2}, \quad \lim  _ {y \rightarrow \infty} \epsilon_ {2} = 0, \quad \lim  _ {y \rightarrow \infty} \epsilon_ {3} = - \frac {4}{3} \frac {p - 1}{2 p - 1}. \tag {5.197}
$$

If  $p$  is an integer, except for the special case  $p = 1$  (see section 4.2), these values are always smaller than unity, but not particularly small. As such, all these models predict large deviation from scale invariance. Indeed, the spectral index at first order is given by

$$
n _ {\mathrm {S}} - 1 \simeq - \frac {8}{3} \left(\frac {p - 1}{2 p - 1}\right) ^ {2}, (5. 1 9 8)
$$

which, for  $p \geq 2$ , remains always smaller than  $-8 / 27 \simeq -0.3$ . This is strongly disfavored by current CMB measurements. Therefore, only the models such that  $p$  is close enough to 1 are to be considered (i.e. non integer values of  $p$ ).

If inflation proceeds in the RpI1 regime, then inflation stops naturally when  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$ , i.e. at the field value

$$
y _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = \ln \left[ (2 p - 1) \frac {1 + 2 p (\sqrt {3} + 1)}{8 p ^ {2} - 4 p - 1} \right]. \tag {5.199}
$$

However, the second Hubble flow function can only take relatively large value. From Eq. (5.195), since  $y < y_{\mathrm{max}}$ , one gets

$$
\epsilon_ {2} > \epsilon_ {2} \left(y _ {\max }\right) = \frac {8}{3} \frac {p - 1}{p}. \tag {5.200}
$$

For  $p \geq 2$ , we are in a situation where  $\epsilon_2 > 4/3$  and again, the models are ruled out by a simple slow roll analysis. Therefore, as already noticed before,  $p$  must take (non integer) close enough to 1 values for the models to be viable.

Finally, in the RpI3 regime, inflation stops naturally when  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$ , with  $y_{\mathrm{end}}$  still given by Eq. (5.199). This expression is defined only if  $p > (1 + \sqrt{3}) / 2\simeq 0.68$  but the first slow roll parameter continuously decreases with  $y$ , and its asymptotic value is again given by Eq. (5.197). Therefore, this regime is viable only when  $p$  is close enough to unity.

Let us now turn to the slow-roll trajectory. It is given by

$$
N - N _ {\text {e n d}} = \frac {3}{4} \left\{\frac {p}{p - 1} \ln \left[ \frac {(p - 1) e ^ {y} + 1 - 2 p}{(p - 1) e ^ {y _ {\text {e n d}}} + 1 - 2 p} \right] + y - y _ {\text {e n d}} \right\}. \tag {5.201}
$$

This expression is not properly defined for  $p = 1$  but this case has already been considered in the section on the Higgs inflation model. When  $p > 1$ , if  $y = y_{\mathrm{max}}$ , the argument of the logarithm vanishes and the total number of  $e$ -folds diverges. As a result, provided inflation starts close enough to the top of the potential, it is always possible to find a long enough inflationary period. For  $p < 1$ , the number of  $e$ -folds diverges when  $y \to \infty$ . The slow-roll trajectory cannot be analytically inverted, but using the same reheating model as in section 4.2, one can solve for the field value  $y_*$  at which the pivot mode crossed out the Hubble radius. The corresponding number of  $e$ -fold  $\Delta N_* = N_{\mathrm{end}} - N_*$  being given by Eq. (5.201).

Concerning the case  $\epsilon = -1$ , i.e. the domain  $y < 0$ , all of the previous formula still apply but the potential is now a monotonic decreasing function of the field  $v e v$  which is too steep to support inflation. In particular, over the whole negative domain, Eq. (5.195) implies that  $\epsilon_{1}(y < 0) > \epsilon_{1}(y \to -\infty) = 4/3$ , independently on whether  $p > 1$  or  $p < 1$ .

Finally, the constant  $M$  can be determined from the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies. It follows that

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {4}} = 1 9 2 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {\left[ 1 + (p - 1) e ^ {y _ {*}} - 2 p \right] ^ {2} e ^ {2 y _ {*}}}{(2 p - 1) ^ {2} \left(e ^ {y _ {*}} - 1\right) ^ {\frac {6 p - 2}{2 p - 1}}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s} - \mathrm {P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.202}
$$

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions of the RpI models are displayed in Fig. 142 for the RpI1 regime, in Fig. 143 for the RpI2 regime, and in Fig. 146 for the RpI3 regime. In the RpI1 regime, the Higgs inflation model predictions (see Fig. 125) are recovered when  $p \to 1$ , and one can see that  $p < 1.02$  is a necessary condition for the spectral index not to be too red. For RpI2 the limit  $p \to 1$  is such that one does not reproduce the Higgs inflation results and for  $y_{\mathrm{end}} \to \infty$  the predictions lie on the line  $\epsilon_{2*} = 0$ . Moreover, one can see that when  $p > 1.1$ , the models predict too much gravity waves to be compatible with the CMB

data. Let us stress that since  $y_{\mathrm{end}}$  is not necessarily small for RpI2, we are in a situation where the numerical value of  $M_{\mathrm{g}}$  may be significantly different than  $M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  (see section 4.2.2). Finally for the RpI3 regimes, the Higgs inflation model predictions (see Fig. 125) are recovered when  $p \to 1$ , and they remain compatible with the data within the two-sigma contours provided  $p > 0.99$ .
