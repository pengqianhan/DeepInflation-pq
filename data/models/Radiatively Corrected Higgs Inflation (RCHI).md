# Radiatively Corrected Higgs Inflation (RCHI)

# Theoretical Justifications

Let us consider again the model given by Eq. (4.76). The three functions describing this action are modified when quantum corrections are taken into account. As a consequence,

the potential which supports inflation is also modified and this leads to a new inflationary scenario that we call Radiatively Corrected Higgs Inflation (RCHI). This scenario has been studied in Refs. [275-280]. At first order,  $M_{\mathrm{g}} \simeq M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the corrections to the function  $Z(h)$  can be neglected while the corrections to  $F(h)$  and to  $U(h)$  read

$$
F (h) = 1 + \xi h ^ {2} + \frac {C}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} h ^ {2} \ln \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} h ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}}\right), \tag {5.1}
$$

$$
U (h) = M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} \frac {\lambda}{4} \left(h ^ {2} - \frac {v ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}\right) ^ {2} + \frac {\lambda A}{1 2 8 \pi^ {2}} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} h ^ {4} \ln \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} h ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}}\right), \tag {5.2}
$$

where  $\mu$  is the renormalization scale and  $A$  and  $C$  are two new constants given by

$$
A = \frac {3}{8 \lambda} \left[ 2 g ^ {4} + \left(g ^ {2} + g ^ {\prime 2}\right) - 1 6 y _ {\mathrm {t}} ^ {4} \right] + 6 \lambda + \mathcal {O} (\xi^ {- 2}), \tag {5.3}
$$

$$
C = 3 \xi \lambda + \mathcal {O} (\xi^ {0}), \tag {5.4}
$$

$y_{\mathrm{t}}$  being the Yukawa coupling of the top quark and  $g$  and  $g^{\prime}$  the coupling constants of the  $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\mathrm{L}}$  and  $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{Y}}$  groups. The presence of quantum corrections modifies the relation between the Jordan and the Einstein frames and changes the shape of the potential in the Einstein frame. Assuming the smallness of  $A / (32\pi^{2}) \ll 1$  and  $C / (8\pi^{2}\xi) \ll 1$ , which is necessary for the consistence of the one-loop calculation (the second condition is in fact equivalent to  $C\lambda / (8\pi^{2}) \ll 1$  because  $C$  is proportional to  $\xi$ ), one obtains the following expression

$$
V \simeq \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4} \lambda}{4 \xi^ {2}} \frac {\xi^ {2} h ^ {4}}{(1 + \xi h ^ {2}) ^ {2}} \left[ 1 - \frac {\xi h ^ {2}}{1 + \xi h ^ {2}} \frac {C}{8 \pi^ {2} \xi} \ln \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} h ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}}\right) + \frac {A}{3 2 \pi^ {2}} \ln \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} h ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}}\right) \right]. (5. 5)
$$

Of course, if  $A = C = 0$ , one checks that this potential reduces to the potential of the previous section. Notice that, at this stage, we have not assumed that  $\xi h^2 \gg 1$ . If we further postulate that  $\xi h^2 \gg 1$  and approximate  $\xi^2 h^4 / (1 + \xi h^2)^2 \simeq 1 - 2 / (\xi h^2)$ , then the above formula reduces to

$$
V \simeq \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4} \lambda}{4 \xi^ {2}} \left[ 1 - \frac {2}{\xi h ^ {2}} + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} \ln \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} h}{\mu}\right) \right], \tag {5.6}
$$

where  $A_{\mathrm{I}} \equiv A - 12\lambda$  is the inflationary anomalous scaling. This formula coincides with Eq. (6) of Ref. [277] and Eq. (9) of Ref. [279]. Although the above formulas give  $V$  in the Einstein frame, it is still expressed in terms of  $h$ . The expression for the field in the Einstein frame,  $\chi$ , remains to be established. Assuming the smallness of the loop corrections, we obtain

$$
\frac {\mathrm {d} \chi}{\mathrm {d} h} \simeq \frac {\sqrt {3} h \xi}{(1 + \xi h ^ {2})} \left[ 1 + \frac {C}{1 6 \pi^ {2} \xi} + \frac {C}{8 \pi^ {2} \xi} \frac {1}{1 + \xi h ^ {2}} \ln \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} h}{\mu}\right) \right]. \tag {5.7}
$$

Notice that, in order to obtain this equation, we have neglected a term proportional to  $1 / (\xi h)^2\ll 1$ . Contrary to the assumption  $\xi h^2\gg 1$ , the condition  $(\xi h)^{2}\gg 1$  was also used in section 4.2. Then, the integration of this differential equation leads to

$$
\chi \simeq \frac {\sqrt {3}}{2} \ln \left(1 + \xi h ^ {2}\right) + \frac {\sqrt {3} C}{1 6 \pi^ {2} \xi} \left[ \ln h - \frac {1}{1 + \xi h ^ {2}} \ln \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} h}{\mu}\right) \right]. \tag {5.8}
$$

Using only now the limit  $\xi h^2\gg 1$  , this expression reduces to

$$
\chi \simeq \frac {\sqrt {3}}{2} \ln (\xi h ^ {2}) + \frac {\sqrt {3} C}{1 6 \pi^ {2} \xi} \ln h. \tag {5.9}
$$

As expected the relation between the Jordan frame field  $h$  and the Einstein frame field  $\chi$  is modified by the quantum corrections. Inverting the above formula gives

$$
\xi^ {1 / 2} h \simeq e ^ {\chi / \sqrt {3}} - \frac {C}{1 6 \pi^ {2} \xi} e ^ {\chi / \sqrt {3}} \left(\frac {\chi}{\sqrt {3}} - \frac {1}{2} \ln \xi\right). (5. 1 0)
$$

This equation allows us to find the expression of the potential in the Einstein frame. Inserting Eq. (5.10) into Eq. (5.6) and introducing the canonically normalized field  $\phi \equiv \sqrt{2} M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\chi$ , one obtains

$$
\begin{array}{l} V (\phi) \simeq \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4} \lambda}{4 \xi^ {2}} \left[ 1 - 2 e ^ {- 2 \phi / (\sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {P l}})} - \frac {C}{4 \pi^ {2} \xi} e ^ {- 2 \phi / (\sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {P l}})} \left(\frac {\phi}{\sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} - \frac {1}{2} \ln \xi\right) \right. \\ \left. + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} \ln \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu \sqrt {\xi}}\right) + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} \frac {\phi}{\sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} \right] \\ \simeq \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4} \lambda}{4 \xi^ {2}} \left[ 1 - 2 e ^ {- 2 \phi / (\sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {P l}})} + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} \frac {\phi}{\sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} \right]. \tag {5.11} \\ \end{array}
$$

We see that we now deal with a "one parameter model",  $A_{\mathrm{I}}$ , since the mass scale  $M^4 \equiv M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^4 \lambda / (4\xi^2)$  is determined by the COBE normalization. In the case  $A_{\mathrm{I}} = 0$ , it is also interesting to compare the above potential with the one given by Eq. (4.88). We see that this corresponds to assuming that the exponential  $e^{-2\phi / (\sqrt{6} M_{\mathrm{Pl}})} \ll 1$  (or, equivalently,  $\phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \gg 1$ ) and to expand the corresponding expression at first order in this small parameter. This leads to the following formula:  $V \simeq M^4 \left[ 1 - 2e^{-2\phi / (\sqrt{6} M_{\mathrm{Pl}})} \right]$ , i.e. exactly Eq. (5.11) for  $A_{\mathrm{I}} = 0$ . It is worth remarking that this approximation is not very good towards the end of inflation. Indeed, it is easy to show that (see below), for the potential (5.11) with  $A_{\mathrm{I}} = 0$ ,  $\phi_{\mathrm{end}} / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} = \sqrt{3/2} \ln \left( 2 + 2 / \sqrt{3} \right) \simeq 1.4$  which should be compared with Eq. (4.49) for the potential (4.88) according to which  $\phi_{\mathrm{end}} / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 0.94$ .

# Slow-Roll Analysis

Given Eq. (5.11), namely

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ 1 - 2 e ^ {- 2 \phi / (\sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {P l}})} + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} \frac {\phi}{\sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} \right], \tag {5.12}
$$

we can now proceed to the slow-roll analysis. The potential (5.12) is represented and compared with its tree level counterpart in Fig. 8. Defining  $x \equiv \phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the three first slow-roll parameters can be written as

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {1}{1 2} \left[ \frac {4 e ^ {- \sqrt {2 / 3} x} + A _ {\mathrm {I}} / (1 6 \pi^ {2})}{1 - 2 e ^ {- \sqrt {2 / 3} x} + A _ {\mathrm {I}} / (3 2 \pi^ {2}) \sqrt {2 / 3} x} \right] ^ {2}, \tag {5.13}
$$

$$
\epsilon_ {2} = \frac {1}{3} \frac {8 e ^ {- \sqrt {2 / 3} x} \left[ 1 + A _ {\mathrm {I}} / (1 6 \pi^ {2}) + A _ {\mathrm {I}} / (3 2 \pi^ {2}) \sqrt {2 / 3} x \right] + A _ {\mathrm {I}} ^ {2} / (2 5 6 \pi^ {4})}{\left[ 1 - 2 e ^ {- \sqrt {2 / 3} x} + A _ {\mathrm {I}} / (3 2 \pi^ {2}) \sqrt {2 / 3} x \right] ^ {2}}, \tag {5.14}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \epsilon_ {3} = 1 2 \left(4 + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} e ^ {\sqrt {2 / 3} x}\right) \left\{4 8 + 8 \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} (9 + \sqrt {6} x) + 3 \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}} ^ {3}}{4 0 9 6 \pi^ {6}} e ^ {2 \sqrt {2 / 3} x} \right. \\ + 2 e ^ {\sqrt {2 / 3} x} \left[ 1 2 + 1 8 \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} \left(1 + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}}\right) + \sqrt {6} \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} \left(4 + 3 \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}}\right) x + 2 \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}} ^ {2}}{2 5 6 \pi^ {4}} x ^ {2} \right] \Bigg \} \\ \times \left[ 2 4 + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} \left(2 4 + 4 \sqrt {6} x + 3 \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} e ^ {\sqrt {2 / 3} x}\right) \right] ^ {- 1} \left[ - 1 2 + e ^ {\sqrt {2 / 3} x} \left(6 + \sqrt {6} \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} x\right) \right] ^ {- 2}. \tag {5.15} \\ \end{array}
$$

These three slow-roll parameters are represented in Fig. 8 (bottom panels). It is interesting to compare these formulas with the expressions derived in Ref. [275] [see Eqs. (22) and (23) of that paper]. An approximate equation for the first slow-roll parameter is obtained by neglecting the second and third terms in the denominator of Eq. (5.13), which, as a matter of fact, consists in writing  $V(\phi) \simeq M^4$ . Then, it follows that

$$
\epsilon_ {1} \simeq \frac {4}{3} e ^ {- 2 \sqrt {2 / 3} x} \left(1 + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{6 4 \pi^ {2}} e ^ {\sqrt {2 / 3} x}\right) ^ {2} \simeq \frac {4}{3} \frac {1}{\xi^ {2} h ^ {4}} \left(1 + \frac {h ^ {2}}{h _ {\mathrm {I}} ^ {2}}\right) ^ {2}, \tag {5.16}
$$

where we have defined  $h_{\mathrm{I}}^{2} \equiv 64\pi^{2} / (\xi A_{\mathrm{I}})$  in agreement with Ref. [275]. The same approximation is made for the second slow-roll parameter (except that Ref. [275] calculates  $\hat{\eta} \equiv M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{2}V_{\phi \phi} / V$  rather than  $\epsilon_{2}$ ). The second field derivative of the potential can be written as  $V_{\phi \phi} = -4M^4 e^{-\sqrt{2 / 3} x} / (3M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2)$  and, therefore, if one considers that  $V(\phi) \simeq M^4$ , then  $\hat{\eta} \simeq -4 / (3\xi h^2)$ . We conclude that our expressions of  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$  reproduce Eqs. (22) and (23) of Ref. [275] in the limit where  $V(\phi) \simeq M^4$ .

Let us now study how inflation ends in this model. From Fig. 8, it is clear that this occurs by violation of the slow-roll conditions. Working out the condition  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$ , it follows that

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}} - \sqrt {\frac {3}{2}} \frac {3 2 \pi^ {2}}{A _ {\mathrm {I}}} + \sqrt {\frac {3}{2}} \mathrm {W} _ {- 1} ^ {0} \left[ \frac {6 4 \pi^ {2}}{A _ {\mathrm {I}}} \left(1 + \frac {1}{\sqrt {3}}\right) e ^ {3 2 \pi^ {2} / A _ {\mathrm {I}} - 1 / \sqrt {3}} \right], \tag {5.17}
$$

where, if  $A_{\mathrm{I}} > 0$ ,  $\mathrm{W}_{0} = \mathrm{W}_{0}$  while, if  $A_{\mathrm{I}} < 0$ ,  $\mathrm{W}_{0} = \mathrm{W}_{-1}$ .

We now turn to the slow-roll trajectory. It can be integrated exactly and straightforward manipulations lead to the following expression

$$
\begin{array}{l} N - N _ {\mathrm {i n i}} = \sqrt {\frac {3}{2}} x - \frac {4 8 \pi^ {2}}{A _ {\mathrm {I}}} \left[ 1 + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{3 2 \pi^ {2}} \left(1 + \sqrt {\frac {2}{3}} x\right) \right] \ln \left(1 + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{6 4 \pi^ {2}} e ^ {\sqrt {2 / 3} x}\right) \\ - \frac {3}{2} \mathrm {L i} _ {2} \left(- \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{6 4 \pi^ {2}} e ^ {\sqrt {2 / 3} x}\right) - \sqrt {\frac {3}{2}} x _ {\mathrm {i n i}} + \frac {4 8 \pi^ {2}}{A _ {\mathrm {I}}} \left[ 1 + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{3 2 \pi^ {2}} \left(1 + \sqrt {\frac {2}{3}} x _ {\mathrm {i n i}}\right) \right] \\ \times \ln \left(1 + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{6 4 \pi^ {2}} e ^ {\sqrt {2 / 3} x _ {\mathrm {i n i}}}\right) + \frac {3}{2} \mathrm {L i} _ {2} \left(- \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{6 4 \pi^ {2}} e ^ {\sqrt {2 / 3} x _ {\mathrm {i n i}}}\right), \tag {5.18} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\mathrm{Li}_2$  denotes the dilogarithm function [281, 282]. Let us also notice that if we use the approximation  $V(\phi) \simeq M^4$  already discussed before, then one can obtain a much simpler formula, namely

$$
N - N _ {\mathrm {i n i}} = - \frac {4 8 \pi^ {2}}{A _ {\mathrm {I}}} \ln \left(1 + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{6 4 \pi^ {2}} e ^ {\sqrt {2 / 3} x}\right) + \frac {4 8 \pi^ {2}}{A _ {\mathrm {I}}} \ln \left(1 + \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{6 4 \pi^ {2}} e ^ {\sqrt {2 / 3} x _ {\mathrm {i n i}}}\right). \tag {5.19}
$$

This expression is in agreement with Eq. (24) of Ref. [275]. In this case, the trajectory can even be inverted and the corresponding expression for the field  $\phi$  reads

$$
x = \sqrt {\frac {3}{2}} \ln \left[ \left(\frac {6 4 \pi^ {2}}{A _ {\mathrm {I}}} + e ^ {\sqrt {2 / 3} x _ {\mathrm {i n i}}}\right) e ^ {A _ {\mathrm {I}} (N - N _ {\mathrm {i n i}}) / (4 8 \pi^ {2})} - \frac {6 4 \pi^ {2}}{A _ {\mathrm {I}}} \right]. \tag {5.20}
$$

We are now in a position where the predictions of the models can be calculated. They are presented in Fig. 125. We see that very negative values of  $A_{\mathrm{I}}$  are incompatible with the CMB while large values of  $A_{\mathrm{I}}$  remain close to the allowed contours. Of course  $|A_{\mathrm{I}}|$  cannot be too large since we have required  $A_{\mathrm{I}} / (64\pi^{2}) \ll 1$ . We have chosen the upper bound in Fig. 125 to be  $A_{\mathrm{I}} = 100$  for which  $A_{\mathrm{I}} / (64\pi^{2}) \simeq 0.16$ , i.e. still a reasonable number. It is interesting to compare these findings with the existing literature. Using the approximate trajectory in Eq. (5.19) and neglecting the contribution originating from the end of inflation, one obtains

$$
x _ {*} = \sqrt {\frac {3}{2}} \ln \left[ \frac {6 4 \pi^ {2}}{A _ {\mathrm {I}}} \left(e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}} - 1\right) \right], \tag {5.21}
$$

where  $x_{\mathrm{BKS}} \equiv A_{\mathrm{I}} \Delta N_{*} / (48\pi^{2})$  ( $x_{\mathrm{BKS}}$  is denoted  $x$  in Ref. [275]). Then, from Eq. (5.16) and

the fact that  $\epsilon_{2} = 4\epsilon_{1} - 2\hat{\eta}$ , it follows that

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {4}{3} \left(\frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{6 4 \pi^ {2}}\right) ^ {2} \left(\frac {e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}}}{e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}} - 1}\right) ^ {2} = \frac {3}{4 \Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}} \left(\frac {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}} e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}}}{e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}} - 1}\right) ^ {2}, \tag {5.22}
$$

$$
\epsilon_ {2} = 4 \epsilon_ {1} + \frac {8}{3} \frac {A _ {\mathrm {I}}}{6 4 \pi^ {2}} \frac {1}{e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}} - 1} = 4 \epsilon_ {1} + \frac {2}{\Delta N _ {*}} \frac {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}}{e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}} - 1}. \tag {5.23}
$$

From these two expressions, one deduces that

$$
n _ {\mathrm {S}} = 1 - \frac {2}{\Delta N _ {*}} \frac {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}}{e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}} - 1}, \quad r = \frac {1 2}{\Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}} \left(\frac {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}} e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}}}{e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}} - 1}\right) ^ {2}. \tag {5.24}
$$

Notice that, in the formula giving the spectral index, the contribution originating from  $\epsilon_{1}$  has been neglected since it scales  $\propto 1 / \Delta N_{*}^{2}$ . These approximate expressions match Eqs. (32) and (34) of Ref. [275]. For  $\Delta N_{*} = 60$ , they can be represented as a line  $r = r(n_{\mathrm{S}})$  in the plane  $(n_{\mathrm{S}},r)$ , the parameter along the curve being  $A_{\mathrm{I}}$ . This line has been plotted in Fig. 9 for  $-30 < A_{\mathrm{I}} < 100$  (thick orange dashed line). Requiring  $n_{\mathrm{S}}$  to be within the  $2\sigma$  Planck  $2018 + \mathrm{Bicep - Keck}$  suggests that  $-8 \lesssim A_{\mathrm{I}} \lesssim 4$  (or  $-12 \lesssim A_{\mathrm{I}} \lesssim 14$  with WMAP, again in agreement with Ref. [275]). These predictions are compared to the exact slow-roll predictions of Fig. 125. As before, the slow-roll predictions are represented by a collection of segments made of circles, each segment corresponding to different values of  $A_{\mathrm{I}}$  and each point of a given segment being in one-to-one correspondence with a given reheating temperature. The exact slow-roll predictions are such that, for  $A_{\mathrm{I}} < 0$ , the segments go to the bottom left side of the figure while for  $A_{\mathrm{I}} \to 100$ , the segments remain close to the allowed contours (see also Fig. 125). In the limit of "large" positive values of  $A_{\mathrm{I}}$ , the exact slow-roll predictions and the predictions based on Eqs. (5.24) significantly differ.

Let us try to identify the origin of this discrepancy more precisely. In order to investigate this issue, we have also represented in Fig. 9, the predictions obtained when the approximate trajectory of Eq. (5.19), the approximate expression of the first slow-roll parameter in Eq. (5.16) and the relation  $\epsilon_{2} = 4\epsilon_{1} - 2\hat{\eta}$  but, now, without neglecting  $\epsilon_{1}$ , are used together with an exact expression for  $\phi_{\mathrm{end}}$ . They are represented by the second collections of segments made of crosses in Fig. 9. We see that for  $A_{\mathrm{I}} \gtrsim 0$ , they differ from the orange dashed thick line and bend towards the upper left part of the plot which is also the direction taken by the exact predictions. This suggests that neglecting the term  $4\epsilon_{1}$  in the expression of  $\epsilon_{2}$  causes a non-negligible error. This is confirmed if, instead of using Eq. (5.24) for  $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ , we now take

$$
n _ {\mathrm {S}} = 1 - \frac {9}{2 \Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}} \left(\frac {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}} e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}}}{e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}} - 1}\right) ^ {2} - \frac {2}{\Delta N _ {*}} \frac {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}}{e ^ {x _ {\mathrm {B K S}}} - 1}, \tag {5.25}
$$

and plot again the line  $r = r(n_{\mathrm{s}})$ . This gives the orange dotted curve which follows the second collection of segments. If, however, we compare the red segments, namely those with  $A_{\mathrm{I}}$  "large", corresponding the exact predictions to the approximate red ones, we see that including the term  $4\epsilon_{1}$  is not sufficient. We conclude that RCHI represents a textbook case for ASPIC. It illustrates that, sometimes, "approximating the slow-roll approximation" can lead to too drastic conclusions, especially given the current accuracy of the data. It is an additional motivation to use the slow-roll method without any other scheme of approximations and this is the essence of the ASPIC project presented in this article.

A last word is in order concerning the constraints on the parameter  $A_{\mathrm{I}}$ . Particle physics implies that  $-48 \lesssim A_{\mathrm{I}} \lesssim -20$  and the previously discussed inaccuracies were concerning

only a weaker upper limit on  $A_{\mathrm{I}}$ . Therefore, when particle physics and cosmological data are simultaneously taken into account, the conclusions of Ref. [275] are unchanged and RCHI remains disfavored.

Finally, the scale  $M$  can be determined from the CMB normalization and this leads to the following expression

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} = 1 2 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}} \frac {\left[ 4 e ^ {- \sqrt {2 / 3} x _ {*}} + A _ {\mathrm {I}} / (1 6 \pi^ {2}) \right] ^ {2}}{\left[ 1 - 2 e ^ {- \sqrt {2 / 3} x _ {*}} + A _ {\mathrm {I}} / (3 2 \pi^ {2}) \sqrt {2 / 3} x _ {*} \right] ^ {3}}. \tag {5.26}
$$

The knowledge of  $\phi_*$  allows us to find the posterior distribution of  $M$ , that is to say of  $\lambda/\xi^2$  or  $\xi$ , since the Higgs self coupling,  $\lambda = m_{\mathrm{H}} / v$ , is now known.
