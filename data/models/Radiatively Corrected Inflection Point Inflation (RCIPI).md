# Radiatively Corrected Inflection Point Inflation (RCIPI)

# Theoretical Justifications

This class of models has been introduced in Ref. [709] and constitutes yet another implementation of the radiative corrections induced by bosonic and fermionic loops onto a monomial

potential of the large-field type (see sections 5.2, 5.4, 5.5 and 7.8). More precisely, Ref. [709] explores the possibility that the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are somehow compensated to generate an inflection-point potential $^{12}$  while never triggering an instability at large-field values. In the case of a quartic tree-level potential,  $V_{4}(\phi) = \lambda \phi^{4}$ , the Coleman-Weinberg corrections (see section 5.11), at large values of the field  $\phi$ , are expected to generate an effective quartic coupling

$$
\lambda (\phi) = \lambda \left(\phi_ {0}\right) + \frac {c _ {1} \left(\phi_ {0}\right)}{2} \ln \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} + \frac {c _ {2} \left(\phi_ {0}\right)}{8} \left[ \ln \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \right] ^ {2} + \dots , \tag {7.170}
$$

where  $\phi_0$  is the typical field value associated with the renormalization scale. Requiring the corrected effective potential to have an inflection point at  $\phi_0$ , namely  $V'(\phi_0) = V''(\phi_0) = 0$ , demands that

$$
c _ {2} \left(\phi_ {0}\right) = - 4 c _ {1} \left(\phi_ {0}\right) = 1 6 \lambda \left(\phi_ {0}\right), \tag {7.171}
$$

and the resulting inflationary potential reads

$$
V _ {4} (\phi) = \lambda \left(\phi_ {0}\right) \phi^ {4} \left\{1 - 2 \ln \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} + 2 \left[ \ln \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \right] ^ {2} + \dots \right\}. \tag {7.172}
$$

Because the relation in Eq. (7.171) requires some tuning between the bosonic and fermionic loop corrections, it is not expected to be exact, simply by the existence of higher order corrections. One can therefore introduce two distortion parameters,  $b_{1}$  and  $b_{2}$ , encoding by how much Eq. (7.171) is violated. One finally obtains an effective quartic potential

$$
V _ {4} (\phi) = \lambda \phi^ {4} \left\{1 - 2 (1 - b _ {1}) \ln \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} + 2 (1 + b _ {2}) \left[ \ln \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \right] ^ {2} \right\}. \tag {7.173}
$$

As done in Ref. [709], the same reasoning can be applied to a monomial large-field potential being a pure mass term  $V_{2}(\phi) = \lambda M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{2}\phi^{2}$ . In that case, the condition for the effective potential to exhibit an inflection point at  $\phi_0$  is modified to

$$
c _ {2} \left(\phi_ {0}\right) = - 2 c _ {1} \left(\phi_ {0}\right) = 4 \lambda \left(\phi_ {0}\right). \tag {7.174}
$$

Including the distortion parameters, the effective quadratic potential becomes

$$
V _ {2} (\phi) = \lambda \phi^ {2} M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} \left\{1 - (1 - b _ {1}) \ln \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} + \frac {1}{2} (1 + b _ {2}) \left[ \ln \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \right] ^ {2} \right\}. \tag {7.175}
$$

In both Eqs. (7.173) and (7.175), the renormalization scale  $\phi_0$  can be completely reabsorbed into a redefinition of the coupling  $\lambda$  and of the distortion parameters  $b_{1}$  and  $b_{2}$ . We therefore define the potential of RCIP as

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left(\frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {p} \left[ 1 + \alpha \ln \left(\frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) + \beta \ln^ {2} \left(\frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) \right], \tag {7.176}
$$

which has three parameters,  $p$ ,  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$ . It is defined for positive field values  $\phi \geq 0$  and we assume  $p > 0$ .

Expanding the logarithmic terms of the effective potential  $V_{4}(\phi)$  in Eq. (7.173), and matching them to Eq. (7.176), one gets for  $p = 4$

$$
M ^ {4} = \lambda M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4} \left[ 1 + 4 (1 - b _ {1}) \ln \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) + 8 (1 + b _ {2}) \ln^ {2} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) \right], \tag {7.177}
$$

with

$$
\alpha = - \frac {4 \left(1 - b _ {1}\right) + 1 6 \left(1 + b _ {2}\right) \ln \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right)}{1 + 4 \left(1 - b _ {1}\right) \ln \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) + 8 \left(1 + b _ {2}\right) \ln^ {2} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right)}, \tag {7.178}
$$

$$
\beta = \frac {8 (1 + b _ {2})}{1 + 4 (1 - b _ {1}) \ln \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) + 8 (1 + b _ {2}) \ln^ {2} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right)}.
$$

For the quadratic potential  $V_{2}(\phi)$ , expanding Eq. (7.175) and identifying the resulting terms with Eq. (7.176) yields for  $p = 2$

$$
M ^ {4} = \lambda M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4} \left[ 1 + 2 (1 - b _ {1}) \ln \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) + 2 (1 + b _ {2}) \ln^ {2} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) \right], \tag {7.179}
$$

with

$$
\alpha = - \frac {2 \left(1 - b _ {1}\right) + 4 \left(1 + b _ {2}\right) \ln \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right)}{1 + 2 \left(1 - b _ {1}\right) \ln \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) + 2 \left(1 + b _ {2}\right) \ln^ {2} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right)}, \tag {7.180}
$$

$$
\beta = \frac {2 (1 + b _ {2})}{1 + 2 (1 - b _ {1}) \ln \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) + 2 (1 + b _ {2}) \ln^ {2} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right)}.
$$

Let us notice that a convenient renormalization scale for simplifying these expressions is  $\phi_0 = M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , for which an inflection point appears at  $\alpha_4 = -4$ ,  $\beta_4 = 8$  and  $\alpha_2 = -2$ ,  $\beta_2 = 2$  (and, more generally, at  $\alpha_p = -p$  and  $\beta_p = p^2 / 2$ ). These expressions also show that, as soon as the inflection point is detuned, a tachyonic mass term appears and slow-roll violations are present in a very same fashion as for SFI2 (see section 6.1).

In order for the potential of RCIPI to remain positive, as requested from its desired stability, one has to impose some restrictions on the parameters  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$ . At large field values, the last term of Eq. (7.176) dominates and the potential is positive only for  $\beta \geq 0$ . Moreover, to prevent the potential to become negative in some intermediate domain, one has to impose

$$
\alpha^ {2} \leq 4 \beta . \tag {7.181}
$$

In the following, we study the generic potential of RCIFI under these conditions while its observable predictions can be narrowed down to the quadratic and quartic cases by using Eqs. (7.177) to (7.180). Let us however notice that the regimes for which the potential could become negative, when driven by the first-order loop corrections, have already been studied within the RCLFI scenario in section 7.8.

# Parameter Space Analysis

For  $\alpha^2 \leq 4\beta$  and  $\beta \geq 0$ , the potential is well-defined and positive for  $\phi \geq 0$ . It has been constructed to possibly have an inflection point, and moving away from this situation, one can have either a monotonic increasing potential with respect to  $\phi$ , or the appearance of both a local maximum and minimum. Defining

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}, \tag {7.182}
$$

the potential is extremal when  $V'(x) = 0$ , i.e. for  $x$  solution of

$$
x ^ {p - 1} [ p + \alpha + (p \alpha + 2 \beta) \ln (x) + p \beta \ln^ {2} (x) ] = 0. \tag {7.183}
$$

For  $p > 1$ , there is an obvious solution at  $x = 0$ , which is also the global vanishing minimum of the potential. We are rather interested in the roots of the second term, which is a quadratic equation in  $\ln (x)$ . The existence of these roots depends on the sign of the determinant

$$
\Delta = 4 \beta^ {2} - p ^ {2} (4 \beta - \alpha^ {2}). \tag {7.184}
$$

The inflection point is recovered when there is only one root to this equation, namely for  $\Delta = 0$  or  $\alpha = \pm \alpha_0$  with

$$
\alpha_ {0} \equiv 2 \sqrt {\beta} \sqrt {1 - \frac {\beta}{p ^ {2}}}. \tag {7.185}
$$

As a result, the inflection point exists only in the domains for which  $\beta \leq p^2$ . If  $|\alpha| < \alpha_0$  then Eq. (7.184) becomes negative and the potential is a monotonic increasing function of the field values. For  $|\alpha| > \alpha_0$  we have  $\Delta > 0$  and Eq. (7.183) admits the two roots

$$
x _ {V ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {\pm} = \exp \left[ \frac {- (p \alpha + 2 \beta) \pm \sqrt {4 \beta^ {2} - p ^ {2} (4 \beta - \alpha^ {2})}}{2 p \beta} \right]. \tag {7.186}
$$

For all the other cases, associated with  $\beta > p^2$ ,  $\Delta > 0$  for all values of  $\alpha$  and the potential always develops two extrema at the locations given by Eq. (7.186). Let us notice that for  $\beta \leq p^2$  and  $\alpha = \pm \alpha_0$  the position of the infection point is also given by Eq. (7.186) in which the square root term vanishes and reads

$$
x _ {0} = \exp \left(- \frac {p \alpha + 2 \beta}{2 p \beta}\right). \tag {7.187}
$$

As soon as Eq. (7.186) has two distinct solutions, the potential of RCPII develops a false vacuum at  $x = x_{V' = 0}^{+}$  in which inflation would become eternal. Within slow-roll, and without resorting to an additional mechanism ending such a phase of inflation (which would make RCPII a four-parameter model), this implies that slow-roll inflation may gracefully end only if it moves away from this false vacuum by going towards the global minimum at  $x = 0$ . We refer to this regime as RCPII1 and it exists only in the domain  $x < x_{V' = 0}^{-}$ . As such, it requires either  $\beta > p^2$ , or  $|\alpha| \geq \alpha_0$  when  $\beta \leq p^2$ . RCPII1 also encompasses the case of a flat inflection point. Let us notice that non-slow roll solutions may exist, as for instance if the field acquires enough kinetic energy in a previous inflationary phase to climb out of the false vacuum, but these situations necessarily violate slow roll. The other slow-roll inflationary regime corresponds to the situation in which the potential is a monotonic increasing function of the field. This happens only for  $\beta \leq p^2$  with  $|\alpha| < \alpha_0$  and inflation proceeds from large to small field values. This regime will be referred to as RCPII2. The location of these two regimes in the parameter space  $(\beta, \alpha)$  have been represented in Fig. 120 for  $p = 2$ .

# Slow-roll Analysis

The first Hubble-flow function in the slow-roll approximation, stemming from the potential of Eq. (7.176), reads

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {\left[ p + \alpha + (p \alpha + 2 \beta) \ln (x) + p \beta \ln^ {2} (x) \right] ^ {2}}{2 x ^ {2} \left[ 1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x) \right] ^ {2}}. \tag {7.188}
$$

The second and third Hubble-flow functions are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {2} = \frac {2}{x ^ {2}} \left\{p + \frac {\alpha^ {2} - 4 \beta}{\left[ 1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x) \right] ^ {2}} + \frac {\alpha + 2 \beta + 2 \beta \ln (x)}{1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x)} \right\}, \tag {7.189}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} p + \alpha + \ln (x) [ p \alpha + 2 \beta + p \beta \ln (x) ] \\ \overline {{x ^ {2} \left\{1 + \ln (x) [ \alpha + \beta \ln (x) ] \right\} ^ {4}}} \left\{p + \frac {\alpha^ {2} - 4 \beta}{[ 1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x) ] ^ {2}} + \frac {\alpha + 2 \beta + 2 \beta \ln (x)}{1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x)} \right\} \\ \times \left\{2 \left(\alpha^ {2} - 4 \beta\right) [ \alpha + 2 \beta \ln (x) ] + [ \alpha + 2 \beta \ln (x) ] [ \alpha + 2 \beta + 2 \beta \ln (x) ] [ 1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x) ] \right. \\ - 2 \beta \left[ 1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x) \right] ^ {2} + 2 \left(\alpha^ {2} - 4 \beta\right) \left[ 1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x) \right] \\ \left. + 2 \left[ \alpha + 2 \beta + 2 \beta \ln (x) \right] \left[ 1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x) \right] ^ {2} + 2 p \left[ 1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x) \right] ^ {3} \right\}. \tag {7.190} \\ \end{array}
$$

In the limit  $x \to 0$  one has  $\epsilon_1(x) \simeq p^2 \ln^2 (x) / (2x^2)$ , which is divergent, and this ensures that inflation always gracefully ends when approaching the global minimum of the potential at  $x = 0$ . The field value  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  at which this occurs is solution of the equation  $\epsilon_1(x) = 1$ , i.e.

$$
p + \alpha + (p \alpha + 2 \beta) \ln (x) + p \beta \ln^ {2} (x) = \pm \sqrt {2} x [ 1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x) ]. \tag {7.191}
$$

It does not admit analytical solution and has to be solved numerically. Moreover it has multiple roots in domains that can be determined by studying the sign of  $\epsilon_{2}(x)$ . This one vanishes for

$$
p \left[ 1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x) \right] ^ {2} + [ \alpha + 2 \beta + 2 \beta \ln (x) ] \left[ 1 + \alpha \ln (x) + \beta \ln^ {2} (x) \right] + \alpha^ {2} - 4 \beta = 0. \tag {7.192}
$$

This is a quartic equation in  $\ln (x)$  and it admits, at maximum, four roots that can be determined analytically and can be found in the ASPIC library. When the potential develops a false vacuum one of these roots lies between the locations of the two potential extrema because, there,  $\epsilon_{1}$  vanishes so it must have a local maximal (where  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes) in between. The other roots correspond to other local extrema of  $\epsilon_{1}(x)$ , which can potentially exceed

unity. However, RCIP1 proceeds at decreasing field values, always with  $x < x_{V' = 0}^{-}$ , and one can show that it never encounters one of the local extrema of  $\epsilon_1$ . Therefore, only the smallest of all roots of Eq. (7.191) gives  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , the field value at which RCIP1 ends. Concerning RCIP12, the situation is more complex. The potential is a monotonic increasing function of  $x$  and RCIP12 inflation proceeds at decreasing field values, from large to small values of  $x$ . Although there is no inflection point, the potential exhibits a change of convexity and  $\epsilon_2$  may still vanish before the end of inflation. Because  $\epsilon_1$  then develops a local maximum, possibly exceeding unity, inflation can be potentially halted before restarting for a few  $e$ -folds to definitely end at  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , this one being still defined as the lowest root of Eq. (7.191). These "hiccups" are necessarily associated with slow-roll violations, but, being located close to the end of inflation, they are not directly observable in the CMB. As it is the case for SAIII3 (see section 7.7), they might however be of some interest for the formation of primordial black holes.

The potential, and the Hubble-flow functions, in the RCIP1 regimes have been represented in Fig. 121 in the case of an inflection point, for  $p = 2$ ,  $\alpha = -2$ ,  $\beta = 2$ , as well as when it is strongly detuned to a hilltop ( $p = 2$ ,  $\alpha = -2.5$  and  $\beta = 2$ ). The potential and Hubble flow functions for RCIP12, when the potential is monotonic, are represented in Fig. 122. As can be seen on the lower left panel of this figure,  $\epsilon_{1}$  may transiently exceed unity before inflation definitely ends.

The slow-roll trajectory is given by the integral

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = \int_ {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}} ^ {x} \frac {y + \alpha y \ln (y) + \beta y \ln^ {2} (y)}{p + \alpha + (p \alpha + 2 \beta) \ln (y) + p \beta \ln^ {2} (y)} \mathrm {d} y. \tag {7.193}
$$

It can be determined analytically after expanding the denominator, which is proportional to  $V'(y)$ , over its roots. Defining the, possibly complex, numbers

$$
z _ {\pm} \equiv \frac {- (p \alpha + 2 \beta) \pm \sqrt {\Delta}}{2 p \beta}, \tag {7.194}
$$

one has for  $\Delta \neq 0$

$$
N _ {\text {e n d}} - N = \frac {1}{\sqrt {\Delta}} \int_ {x _ {\text {e n d}}} ^ {x} \frac {y + \alpha y \ln (y) + \beta y \ln^ {2} (y)}{\ln (y) - z _ {+}} \mathrm {d} y - \frac {1}{\sqrt {\Delta}} \int_ {x _ {\text {e n d}}} ^ {x} \frac {y + \alpha y \ln (y) + \beta y \ln^ {2} (y)}{\ln (y) - z _ {-}} \mathrm {d} y. \tag {7.195}
$$

Let us notice that, for  $\Delta > 0$ , one has  $x_{V' = 0}^{\pm} = \exp(z_{\pm})$ . All the terms obtained by expanding the numerators of Eq. (7.195) can be expressed as exponential integrals, and, after some algebra, one gets

$$
\begin{array}{l} N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = \frac {x ^ {2} - x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}}{2 p} + \frac {e ^ {2 z _ {+}} \left(1 + \alpha z _ {+} + \beta z _ {+} ^ {2}\right)}{\sqrt {\Delta}} \left\{\mathrm {E i} \left[ 2 \ln (x) - 2 z _ {+} \right] - \mathrm {E i} \left[ 2 \ln (x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}) - 2 z _ {+} \right] \right\} \\ - \frac {e ^ {2 z _ {-}} \left(1 + \alpha z _ {-} + \beta z _ {-} ^ {2}\right)}{\sqrt {\Delta}} \left\{\operatorname {E i} \left[ 2 \ln (x) - 2 z _ {-} \right] - \operatorname {E i} \left[ 2 \ln \left(x _ {\text {e n d}}\right) - 2 z _ {-} \right] \right\}. \tag {7.196} \\ \end{array}
$$

Let us notice that, for RCPI1, when  $x \to x_{V' = 0}^{-}$  the argument of the exponential integral becomes very small, and negative. In this limit, one has  $\operatorname{Ei}(x) \to \gamma + \ln(-x)$  and the logarithmic divergence implies that an arbitrarily large number of  $e$ -folds can be realized at the top of the local maximum. However, the argument of the exponential integral being a logarithm of the field value, it is very slowly divergent, not faster than  $\Delta N \propto -\ln[-2\ln(x/x_{V' = 0}^{-}]$ . In

other words, to obtain 60  $e$ -folds of inflation at the top of the local maximum, one should fine tune the initial field values as  $x / x_{V' = 0}^{-} < \exp [-e^{-60}]\simeq 1 - e^{-60}$ .

The case of a flat inflection point for  $\alpha = \pm \alpha_0$  implies that  $\Delta = 0$  and requires special treatment. Denoting

$$
z _ {0} \equiv \ln \left(x _ {0}\right) = - \frac {p \alpha + 2 \beta}{2 p \beta}, \tag {7.197}
$$

one can replace the denominator of Eq. (7.193) by

$$
p + \alpha + (p \alpha + 2 \beta) \ln (y) + p \beta \ln^ {2} (y) = p \beta [ \ln (y) - z _ {0} ] ^ {2}. \tag {7.198}
$$

After expressing all terms of Eq. (7.193) as exponential integrals, one gets for  $\Delta = 0$

$$
\begin{array}{l} N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = e ^ {2 z _ {0}} \left[ 2 + \alpha + 2 (\alpha + \beta) z _ {0} + 2 \beta z _ {0} ^ {2} \right] \left\{\mathrm {E i} \left[ 2 \ln (x) - 2 z _ {0} \right] - \mathrm {E i} \left[ 2 \ln (x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}) - 2 z _ {0} \right] \right\} \\ + \frac {x ^ {2} \left[ 2 + (2 \alpha + \beta) z _ {0} + 2 \beta z _ {0} ^ {2} - \beta \ln (x) \right]}{2 z _ {0} - 2 \ln (x)} \\ - \frac {x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2} \left[ 2 + (2 \alpha + \beta) z _ {0} + 2 \beta z _ {0} ^ {2} - \beta \ln \left(x _ {\text {e n d}}\right) \right]}{2 z _ {0} - 2 \ln \left(x _ {\text {e n d}}\right)}. \tag {7.199} \\ \end{array}
$$

This time, for RCIP1 and  $x \to x_{V' = 0}^{-}$ , we see that  $\Delta N$  is divergent as  $1 / \ln (x_0 / x)$  and getting enough  $e$ -folds of inflation close to the inflection point requires only  $x / x_0 < e^{-1 / \Delta N} \simeq 1 - 1 / \Delta N$ .

From the numerical solution  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , the analytical trajectories of Eqs. (7.196) and (7.199), and the reheating equation (3.48), one can determine  $x_*$ , the field value at which the pivot mode crosses the Hubble radius during inflation. It fixes the normalization of the potential  $M^4$  from the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies and one has

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} \frac {\left[ p + \alpha + (p \alpha + 2 \beta) \ln \left(x _ {*}\right) + p \beta \ln^ {2} \left(x _ {*}\right) \right] ^ {2}}{x _ {*} ^ {p + 2} \left[ 1 + \alpha \ln \left(x _ {*}\right) + \beta \ln^ {2} \left(x _ {*}\right) \right] ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {7.200}
$$

The reheating-consistent slow-roll predictions for RCIP1 are represented in Figs. 488 to 502 and for RCIP12 in Figs. 503 to 513. As already noticed, successful inflation near the detuned inflection point requires quite some fine-tuning and the presence of a tachyonic mass induces a strong sensitivity of the observables with respect to the model parameters. For both RCIP1 and RCIP12, small values of  $\beta$  allow for just enough inflation to make observable the "distorted parts of the potential. Due to the potentially large values of  $\epsilon_{2}$  and  $\epsilon_{3}$ , the model predictions explore a large part of the space  $(n_{\mathrm{S}},r)$  even for small changes in the parameter  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$ .
