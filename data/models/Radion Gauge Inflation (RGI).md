# Radion Gauge Inflation (RGI)

This model was studied in Ref. [478]. It is an extension of the gauge inflation scenario in which the radius modulus field around which the Wilson loop is wrapped assists inflation as it shrinks [311]. Assuming that the radion field value is such that the potential energy is minimal, for each value of the inflaton field  $\phi$ , one can derive an effective potential

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \frac {\left(\phi / M _ {\mathrm {P l}}\right) ^ {2}}{\alpha + \left(\phi / M _ {\mathrm {P l}}\right) ^ {2}}, \tag {5.226}
$$

where  $\alpha$  is a dimensionless positive parameter. In the context of Ref. [478], the model is natural for  $\alpha < 1$  but larger than unity values are not forbidden. The same potential has been obtained in Ref. [479] in the context of S-dual superstring models. In that case,  $\alpha$  represents a typical  $vev$  for the inflaton, in Planck units. Defining  $x = \phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the first three slow-roll parameters read

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {2 \alpha^ {2}}{x ^ {2} (\alpha + x ^ {2}) ^ {2}}, \qquad \epsilon_ {2} = 4 \alpha \frac {\alpha + 3 x ^ {2}}{x ^ {2} (\alpha + x ^ {2}) ^ {2}}, \qquad \epsilon_ {3} = 4 \alpha \frac {\alpha^ {2} + 3 \alpha x ^ {2} + 6 x ^ {4}}{x ^ {2} (\alpha + x ^ {2}) ^ {2} (\alpha + 3 x ^ {2})}. (5. 2 2 7)
$$

The potential, its logarithm, and the Hubble flow functions are represented in Fig. 31.

The slow-roll trajectory can be integrated analytically from Eq. (3.11) to obtain

$$
N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = \frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}}{4} + \frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {4}}{8 \alpha} - \frac {x ^ {2}}{4} - \frac {x ^ {4}}{8 \alpha}. (5. 2 2 8)
$$

Moreover, it can be inverted explicitly to give the field values in terms of the number of  $e$ -folds as

$$
x = \sqrt {- \alpha + \sqrt {- 8 \alpha (N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}}) + (\alpha + x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}) ^ {2}}}. \tag {5.229}
$$

The end of inflation naturally occurs for  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$ , i.e., from Eq. (5.227), at the field value  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  given by

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} = \frac {- \sqrt [ 3 ]{6} \alpha + \left[ 9 \alpha + \sqrt {3 \alpha^ {2} (2 \alpha + 2 7)} \right] ^ {2 / 3}}{1 6 2 ^ {1 / 6} \left[ 9 \alpha + \sqrt {3 \alpha^ {2} (2 \alpha + 2 7)} \right] ^ {1 / 3}}. \tag {5.230}
$$

As for the MHI models, one should pay attention that

$$
\epsilon_ {2} - \epsilon_ {1} = 2 \alpha \frac {\alpha + 6 x ^ {2}}{x ^ {2} (\alpha + x ^ {2}) ^ {2}} > 0, \tag {5.231}
$$

for any positive values of  $\alpha$ . As a result, slow-roll violation, i.e.  $\epsilon_{2} > 1$ , occurs in RGI before inflation ends. However, since the first Hubble flow function is monotonic, this is not very problematic as it happens only during a negligible number of  $e$ -folds and only around  $N_{\mathrm{end}}$ . The slow-roll observable predictions therefore remain accurate.

As before, the observable field value  $x_{*}$  is obtained by solving Eq. (3.48) for a given reheating model and allows the determination of the parameter  $M$  from the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies. One gets

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} = \frac {2 8 8 0 \pi^ {2} \alpha^ {2}}{x _ {*} ^ {4} \left(\alpha + x _ {*} ^ {2}\right)} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.232}
$$

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for these models are displayed in Fig. 149. Large values of  $\alpha$  give back the same predictions as the large field models with  $p = 2$  (see section 5.2) having  $\epsilon_{2*} = 2\epsilon_{1*}$ .
