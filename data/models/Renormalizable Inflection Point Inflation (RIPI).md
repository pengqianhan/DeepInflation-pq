# Renormalizable Inflection Point Inflation (RIPI)

# Theoretical Justifications

In section 5.17 inflation is implemented within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) around a flat inflection point. Here, we consider a similar model but with  $n = 3$  instead of  $n = 6$ . Such a scenario can emerge in the following situation, see Refs. [502, 503]. Let us consider the MSSM with three additional superfields  $N_{i}$  representing three righthanded neutrinos. These fields are singlet under the standard model gauge group but this one can be extended to  $\mathrm{SU}(3)_c \times \mathrm{SU}(2)_\mathrm{L} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{Y} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{B - L}}$  and the  $N_{i}$  are assumed to be charged under the extra  $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{B - L}}$ . Then, we postulate the following superpotential

$$
W = W _ {\mathrm {M S S M}} + h N H _ {u} L, \tag {5.262}
$$

where  $h \lesssim 10^{-12}$  in order to explain the neutrino mass,  $m_{\nu} \simeq \mathcal{O}(0.1)$  eV. It follows that  $NH_{u}L$  is a  $D$ -flat direction of the potential and we parametrize this direction by  $\phi$ . As a consequence, if one now calculates the corresponding potential, one finds that

$$
V = \frac {1}{2} m _ {\phi} ^ {2} \phi^ {2} - \frac {A h}{6 \sqrt {3}} \phi^ {3} + \frac {h ^ {2}}{1 2} \phi^ {4}, \tag {5.263}
$$

where, as usual, we have included the soft supersymmetry breaking terms (since  $W \propto \phi^3$ , the  $A$ -term, proportional to  $\phi \partial W / \partial \phi$  is, this time, cubic) and have minimized  $V$  along the angular direction. If  $A$  is chosen such that  $A = 4m_{\phi}$ , then we have a flat inflection point at  $\phi_0 = \sqrt{3} m_{\phi} / h$ . A discussion on the fine-tuning required to get a flat inflection point can be found in section 6.7,

# Slow-Roll Analysis

We now turn to the slow-roll analysis of the potential given in Eq. (5.263). For this purpose, it is more convenient to re-write it as

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} - \frac {4}{3} \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {3} + \frac {1}{2} \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {4} \right], \tag {5.264}
$$

where we have defined the quantities  $M$  and  $\phi_0$  by

$$
M ^ {4} = \frac {1}{2} m _ {\phi} ^ {2} \phi_ {0} ^ {2}, \quad \phi_ {0} = \sqrt {3} \frac {m _ {\phi}}{h}. \tag {5.265}
$$

Relevant values of  $m_{\phi}$  range from 100 GeV to 10 TeV and  $h\simeq 10^{-12}$ . This means that [502, 503]

$$
\phi_ {0} \simeq 1 0 ^ {1 4} \mathrm {G e V}, \tag {5.266}
$$

a value that turns out to be similar to the one considered in the MSSMI case (see section 5.17).

Let us now define the quantity  $x$  by the following expression

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}. \tag {5.267}
$$

The potential is an increasing function of the field  $vev$ , hence inflation proceeds from the right to the left. It has two inflection points  $x_{V''=0}^{\pm}$ , given by

$$
x _ {V ^ {\prime \prime} = 0} ^ {-} = \frac {1}{3} \quad \text {a n d} \quad x _ {V ^ {\prime \prime} = 0} ^ {+} = 1, \tag {5.268}
$$

the second one being a flat inflection point [i.e.  $V^{\prime}\left(x_{V^{\prime \prime} = 0}^{+}\right) = 0]$ , close to which inflation takes place. This potential is displayed in Fig. 34, together with its logarithm.

Let us now turn to the slow-roll parameters. The first three Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = 7 2 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {(x - 1) ^ {4}}{(3 x ^ {3} - 8 x ^ {2} + 6 x) ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = 2 4 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} (x - 1) \frac {3 x ^ {3} - 9 x ^ {2} + 1 0 x - 6}{(3 x ^ {3} - 8 x ^ {2} + 6 x) ^ {2}}, \tag {5.269}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \epsilon_ {3} = 2 4 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} (x - 1) (3 6 - 1 4 4 x + 2 4 6 x ^ {2} - 2 3 6 x ^ {3} + 1 4 4 x ^ {4} - 5 4 x ^ {5} + 9 x ^ {6}) \\ \times \left(6 x - 8 x ^ {2} + 3 x ^ {3}\right) ^ {- 2} \left(1 0 x - 9 x ^ {2} + 3 x ^ {3} - 6\right) ^ {- 1}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Both  $\epsilon_{1}(x)$  and  $\epsilon_{2}(x)$  diverge when the field  $v ev$  goes to 0, and vanish when the field  $v ev$  goes to infinity. The first slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{1}$  first decreases, vanishes at  $x_{V^{\prime \prime} = 0}^{+}$  where  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes too,  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^{-} = x_{V^{\prime \prime} = 0}^{+}$ , then increases to reach a local maximum at  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^{+}$  where  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes again, and eventually decreases again. The value of  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^{+}$  is given by

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {+} = 1 - \frac {1}{3 (9 + \sqrt {8 2}) ^ {1 / 3}} + \frac {1}{3} (9 + \sqrt {8 2}) ^ {1 / 3} \simeq 1. 7 5. \tag {5.270}
$$

In between these two local extrema of  $\epsilon_{1}$ , the second slow roll parameter  $\epsilon_{2}$  is negative, and it is positive elsewhere. The value of  $\epsilon_{1}$  at its local maximum,  $\epsilon_{1}^{\max}$ , is given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} ^ {\max } \simeq 5. 2 7 5 3 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}. \tag {5.271}
$$

Therefore, if  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \lesssim 2.3$ , inflation can stop by slow-roll violation in the region corresponding to  $vev$ 's larger than that of the second inflection point  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^+$ . Remembering that typically  $\phi_0 \simeq 10^{14} \mathrm{GeV} \simeq 4 \times 10^{-5} M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , this condition is easily satisfied. In that case, an expression

for the vev at which inflation ends,  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^+$ , can be obtained but is does not add much to the discussion since for reasonable values of  $\phi_0$ , it is extremely far from the flat inflection point (e.g. for  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} = 10^{-4}$ , one has  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^+ \simeq 28285$ ). Since the potential is introduced in order to study inflation in the vicinity of the flat inflection point, it should be studied in the other regime, as it is the case for MSSM inflation (see section 5.17), i.e. when inflation takes place between  $x = 0$  and the second inflection point  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^-$ . In that situation, it ends at

$$
\begin{array}{l} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = x _ {\epsilon_ {1} = 1} ^ {-} = \frac {1}{9} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}} \bigg [ 6 \sqrt {2} + 8 \frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} + 2 \left(- 3 6 + 6 \sqrt {2} \frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} - 5 \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}\right) \\ \times \left(2 1 6 \frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} - 9 9 \sqrt {2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + 1 3 6 \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {3}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {3}} - 4 3 2 \sqrt {2} \right. \\ + 2 7 \sqrt {2} \sqrt {- 7 2 \sqrt {2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {3}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {3}} + 3 3 \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} - 1 6 \sqrt {2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {5}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {5}} + 1 2 \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {6}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {6}}} \Bigg) ^ {- 1 / 3} \\ - \left(2 1 6 \frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} - 9 9 \sqrt {2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + 1 3 6 \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {3}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {3}} - 4 3 2 \sqrt {2} \right. \\ \left. + 2 7 \sqrt {2} \sqrt {- 7 2 \sqrt {2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {3}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {3}} + 3 3 \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} - 1 6 \sqrt {2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {5}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {5}} + 1 2 \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {6}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {6}}}\right) ^ {1 / 3} \rbrack . \tag {5.272} \\ \end{array}
$$

For  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \ll 1$ , one can numerically check that this expression is very close to the flat inflection point location  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^-$ , namely

$$
x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} \simeq 1 - \sqrt {6 \sqrt {2} \frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}}. \tag {5.273}
$$

The whole inflationary stage therefore proceeds in the vicinity of this point.

The slow-roll trajectory is obtained from Eq. (3.11) and reads

$$
\begin{array}{l} N _ {\text {e n d}} - N = \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left[ - \frac {x}{6} + \frac {x ^ {2}}{8} + \frac {1}{1 2 (1 - x)} - \frac {\ln (1 - x)}{1 2} \right. \tag {5.274} \\ \left. + \frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{6} - \frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}}{8} - \frac {1}{1 2 (1 - x _ {\mathrm {e n d}})} + \frac {\ln (1 - x _ {\mathrm {e n d}})}{1 2} \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

Several remarks are in order. Firstly, from this expression, one can see that the number of  $e$ -folds diverges when the field approaches the inflection point of the potential. This means that this point is never crossed and that, if inflation proceeds for  $vev$ 's larger than that of this inflection point, then the field approaches it asymptotically but never actually reaches it. However, an exact numerical integration of the equations of motion reveals that, if the field approaches the inflection point in such a way that the slow-roll conditions are not satisfied, then it can cross it. This is typically the case if its speed is large enough. On the other hand, the field dynamics at the exact location of the inflection point is dominated by quantum diffusion, and a more careful study must be carried out to describe what exactly happens there. Following the considerations of section 5.17, we focus on the inflationary regime only in the region where the  $vev$  of  $\phi$  is smaller than that of the flat inflection and where deviations from slow-roll and quantum diffusion plays a negligible role. Since for  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \ll 1$  inflation

takes place relatively close to the inflection point, the two last terms of Eq. (5.274) dominate over the two first ones. In this limit, the trajectory can be inverted to get

$$
x _ {*} \simeq 1 - W _ {0} ^ {- 1} \left\{\exp \left[ 1 2 \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \Delta N _ {*} + \frac {1}{1 - x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}} - \ln \left(1 - x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}\right) \right] \right\}. (5. 2 7 5)
$$

Making use of Eq. (5.273), and keeping only the dominant terms in  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , one obtains

$$
x _ {*} \simeq 1 - \frac {1}{1 2} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*}}. \tag {5.276}
$$

This expression can be useful to determine typical values for the slow-roll parameters evaluated at Hubble crossing. One obtains

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \simeq \frac {1}{2 8 8} \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*} ^ {4}} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {6}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {6}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2 *} \simeq \frac {4}{\Delta N _ {*}} \quad \epsilon_ {3 *} \simeq \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \tag {5.277}
$$

hence

$$
r \simeq \frac {1}{1 8} \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*} ^ {4}} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {6}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {6}}, \qquad n _ {\mathrm {S}} - 1 \simeq - \frac {4}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \qquad \alpha_ {\mathrm {S}} \simeq - \frac {4}{\Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}}. (5. 2 7 8)
$$

One can see that these models typically predict a tiny amount of gravitational waves, but a substantial deviation from scale invariance  $n_{\mathrm{S}} - 1 \simeq -4 / \Delta N_* \simeq 0.1$ . The similarity with Eqs. (5.260) is obvious.

Finally, the parameter  $M$  can be determined from the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies and the observable field value  $x_{*} = x(N_{*})$  by

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 6 2 2 0 8 0 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \pi^ {2} \frac {(x _ {*} - 1) ^ {4}}{x _ {*} ^ {4} (3 x _ {*} ^ {2} - 8 x _ {*} + 3) ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.279}
$$

For  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \ll 1$ , one can make use of Eq. (5.276) to get the approximate expression

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} \simeq 3 0 \frac {\pi^ {2}}{\Delta N _ {*} ^ {4}} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {6} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. (5. 2 8 0)
$$

Using the typical value  $\phi_0\simeq 10^{14}\mathrm{GeV}$ , one gets  $M / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\simeq 5\times 10^{-11}$ .

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions of the renormalizable inflection point models are displayed in Fig. 151. The reheating equation of state parameter  $\overline{w}_{\mathrm{reh}}$  has been taken to 0 since the potential is quadratic close to its minimum. One can check that in the limit  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \ll 1$ , the first slow-roll parameter is indeed extremely small, while the second slow-roll parameter does not depend much on  $\phi_0$ . Remembering that  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \simeq 10^{-4}$ , one can see that these models are disfavored by the CMB data since they predict a too large deviation from scale invariance. In order to remain inside the two-sigma confidence intervals, these models should be such that  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \gg 1$ , for which they are close to the large field models (LFI, see section 5.2). However, such values for  $\phi_0$  are, a priori, outside the range of validity of the RIPI scenario. Finally, comparing Fig. 150 with Fig. 151, one can see that the general features of RIPI are very close to the MSSMI ones, and that the conclusions drawn before are therefore robust against the precise value of the power index  $n$  in Eq. (5.244).
