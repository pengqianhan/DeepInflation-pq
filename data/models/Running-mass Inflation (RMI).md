# Running-mass Inflation (RMI)

# Theoretical Justifications

This model has been derived and studied in Refs. [418, 670-678]. Following Ref. [673], let us briefly discuss its physical origin. At tree level, a potential can always be expanded as  $V(\phi) \simeq M^4 + m^2\phi^2 / 2 + \lambda \phi^4 / 4 + \dots$ . Since the potential must be flat to support inflation, quantum corrections may play an important role. Typically, they modify the potential with a term of the form  $(c_1 + c_2\phi^2 + c_4\phi^4)\ln (\phi /\mu)$ , where  $\mu$  is the renormalization scale. In a non-supersymmetric framework, the quartic term dominates and one is led to models similar to RCMI, RCQI or CWI, see section 5.4, 5.5 and 5.11. On the other hand, in a supersymmetric context, at least if supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, the quadratic and the quartic terms cancel and one is left with a model similar to LI, see sections 5.12. If, however, supersymmetry is explicitly broken by the presence of soft terms, then the most important term will be the quadratic one.

Concretely, the above reasoning leads to a specific shape for the inflaton potential. We start from a flat direction in supersymmetry. Then, we assume that supersymmetry is explicitly broken and, as a consequence, that the potential receives corrections  $\propto m^2\phi^2$ , where  $m$  is a soft mass. Higher order terms are supposed to be negligible since we assume  $\phi /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\ll 1$ . We thus have

$$
V = V _ {0} + \frac {1}{2} m ^ {2} \phi^ {2} + \dots , \tag {7.1}
$$

The one loop corrections to this tree potential will typically induce a logarithmic dependence of the soft mass through the renormalization group equation

$$
\frac {\mathrm {d} m ^ {2}}{\mathrm {d} \ln \phi} = \beta_ {\mathrm {m a t}}, \tag {7.2}
$$

where  $\beta_{\mathrm{mat}}$  is proportional to the inflaton couplings with the other fields present in the theory. Therefore, by Taylor expanding the solution of the previous equation aroused  $\phi = \bar{\phi}$ , we can write

$$
m ^ {2} = m ^ {2} (\bar {\phi}) + \beta_ {\mathrm {m a t}} \ln \left(\frac {\phi}{\bar {\phi}}\right) + \dots . \tag {7.3}
$$

As a consequence, the potential (7.1) can be re-expressed as

$$
V (\phi) = V _ {0} + \frac {1}{2} m ^ {2} (\bar {\phi}) \phi^ {2} + \frac {1}{2} \beta_ {\mathrm {m a t}} \phi^ {2} \ln \left(\frac {\phi}{\bar {\phi}}\right). \tag {7.4}
$$

As noticed in Refs. [673, 676, 678], the beta function can typically be expressed as

$$
\beta_ {\mathrm {m a t}} = \frac {- 2 C}{\pi} \alpha \tilde {m} ^ {2} + \frac {D}{1 6 \pi^ {2}} | \lambda | ^ {2} m _ {\mathrm {l o o p}} ^ {2}, \tag {7.5}
$$

if we assume that the inflaton interacts with gauge bosons and fermions. The quantity  $\alpha$  is the coupling constant between  $\phi$  and the gauge boson,  $\lambda$  is a Yukawa coefficient,  $\tilde{m}$  is the gaugino mass,  $m$  the fermionic mass and  $C$  and  $D$  are dimensionless numbers of order one.

In the next section, we explore the cosmological consequences of this type of potential. In particular, we will see that it can lead to four different kinds of inflationary scenarios.

# Slow-Roll Analysis

We now perform the slow-roll analysis of the potential previously derived. In order to carry out this task, it is more convenient to re-write the potential as follows

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ 1 - \frac {c}{2} \left(- \frac {1}{2} + \ln \frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right) \frac {\phi^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \right], \tag {7.6}
$$

where we have defined the two parameters  $c$  and  $\phi_0$  by

$$
c = - \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2} \beta_ {\mathrm {m a t}}}{2 V _ {0}}, \quad m ^ {2} (\bar {\phi}) = - \beta_ {\mathrm {m a t}} \left[ \frac {1}{2} + \ln \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{\bar {\phi}}\right) \right]. \tag {7.7}
$$

In this expression,  $M$ ,  $c$  and  $\phi_0$  are free parameters. The dimensionless parameter  $c$  can be positive or negative. With the form of the beta function given in Eq. (7.5), the coefficient  $c$  is given by  $\alpha m^2 M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 / V_0$ . If one assumes that the soft masses are of order  $m \simeq H \simeq V_0^{1/2} / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2$ , then  $c \simeq \alpha \simeq 10^{-2}$  to  $10^{-1}$  or may be smaller depending on the assumption on the couplings. This also means that, in order for Eq. (7.3) to be valid, one has  $|\ln (\phi / \phi_0)| \ll 1$ . Also, the model is commonly worked out in the vacuum dominated regime (otherwise it is equivalent to a large field model, LFI, see section 5.2), which means that  $c \phi_0^2 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 \ll 1$ . The location  $\phi = \phi_0$  is an extremum of  $V(\phi)$ , a maximum if  $c > 0$  and a minimum if  $c < 0$ . The potential and its logarithm are represented in Fig. 100.

Running mass inflation can be realized in four different ways [673], denoted as RMI1, RMI2, RMI3 and RMI4 in what follows. RMI1 corresponds to the case where  $c > 0$  and

$\phi < \phi_0$ , see Fig. 100 (top panels). In this case,  $\phi$  decreases during inflation which proceeds from the right to the left. RMI2 also corresponds to  $c > 0$  but with  $\phi > \phi_0$  and  $\phi$  increases during inflation which now proceeds from the left to the right. RMI3 refers to the situation where  $c < 0$  and  $\phi < \phi_0$  all the time. In this case,  $\phi$  increases during inflation which proceeds from the left to the right. Finally, RMI4 has  $c < 0$  and  $\phi > \phi_0$  decreases as inflation proceeds from the right to the left.

Using the potential (7.6), one can calculate the three slow-roll parameters  $\epsilon_{1}$ ,  $\epsilon_{2}$  and  $\epsilon_{3}$ . Defining  $x\equiv \phi /\phi_0$ , one obtains the following expressions

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {c ^ {2}}{2} \left[ \frac {\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} x \ln x}{1 - \frac {c}{2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left(- \frac {1}{2} + \ln x\right) x ^ {2}} \right] ^ {2}, \tag {7.8}
$$

$$
\epsilon_ {2} = 2 c \frac {1 + \frac {c}{4} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} x ^ {2} + \left(1 - \frac {c}{4} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} x ^ {2}\right) \ln x + \frac {c}{2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} x ^ {2} \ln^ {2} x}{\left[ 1 - \frac {c}{2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left(- \frac {1}{2} + \ln x\right) x ^ {2} \right] ^ {2}}, \tag {7.9}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \epsilon_ {3} = \frac {c \ln x}{\left[ 1 - \frac {c}{2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left(- \frac {1}{2} + \ln x\right) x ^ {2} \right] ^ {2}} \left[ 1 + \frac {c}{4} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} x ^ {2} + \left(1 - \frac {c}{4} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} x ^ {2}\right) \ln x + \frac {c}{2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} x ^ {2} \ln^ {2} x \right] ^ {- 1} \\ \times \left[ 1 + \frac {c}{2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} x ^ {2} + \frac {c ^ {2}}{1 6} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} x ^ {4} + c \left(2 \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} x ^ {2} + \frac {c}{2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} x ^ {4}\right) \ln x \right. \\ + c \left(3 \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} x ^ {2} - \frac {c}{2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} x ^ {4}\right) \ln^ {2} x + \frac {c ^ {2}}{2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} x ^ {4} \ln^ {3} x ]. \tag {7.10} \\ \end{array}
$$

The slow-roll parameters are represented in the bottom panels in Fig. 100.

Let us now examine how inflation ends in this model. The slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{1}$  has a maximum in the  $x < 1$  region and a maximum in the  $x > 1$  region, see Fig. 100. If these maxima were larger than one, inflation could in principle stop by violation of the slow-roll conditions. In the vacuum dominated approximation, however, we see from Eq. (7.8), that  $\epsilon_{1} \simeq (c^{2}/2)(\phi_{0}^{2}/M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{2})x^{2}\ln^{2}x$ . This means that the vev  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  satisfies  $x_{\mathrm{end}}\ln x_{\mathrm{end}} = \pm (\sqrt{2}/c)(M_{\mathrm{Pl}}/\phi_{0})$ . But we have established previously that the vacuum dominated condition precisely implies that  $cM_{\mathrm{Pl}}/\phi_{0} \gg 1$  and one would have  $\ln x_{\mathrm{end}} \gg 1$ . But for the model to be valid, we have already mentioned that the condition  $|\ln x| \ll 1$  should be enforced. We conclude that the value of  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  obtained above lies outside the regime of validity of the potential. The end of inflation either occurs by violation of slow-roll but in a regime where additional unknown corrections arise and modify the shape of  $V(\phi)$ , or by tachyonic instability. In this last case, inflation stops in a regime where our calculations are valid. This also means that we must consider an additional parameter in the model, namely  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . In this article, this is the assumption made which implies that RMI is indeed a three parameters model.

We now turn to the calculation of the observable predictions. The first step is to obtain the slow-roll trajectory. One obtains

$$
\begin{array}{l} N - N _ {\text {e n d}} = \frac {1}{c} (\ln | \ln x | - \ln | \ln x _ {\text {e n d}} |) - \frac {1}{4} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} (x ^ {2} - x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2}) \tag {7.11} \\ + \frac {1}{4} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}\right) ^ {2} \left[ \mathrm {E i} \left(2 \ln x\right) - \mathrm {E i} \left(2 \ln x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}\right) \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

where the exponential integral function  $\operatorname{Ei}$  is defined by  $\operatorname{Ei}(x) \equiv -\int_{-x}^{+\infty} \mathrm{d}te^{-t} / t$  [281, 282]. This expression cannot be inverted analytically. However, in the limit  $(c\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}})x \ll 1$  (the vacuum dominated regime), the above expression can be approximated by

$$
N - N _ {\text {e n d}} \simeq \frac {1}{c} (\ln | \ln x | - \ln | \ln x _ {\text {e n d}} |), \tag {7.12}
$$

from which it follows that

$$
x (N) = \exp \left[ e ^ {c \left(N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}}\right)} \ln x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} \right]. \tag {7.13}
$$

The slow-roll predictions of the four models, RMI1, RMI2, RMI3 and RMI4 are presented in Figs. 323, 327, 331 and 335 for  $|c| = 10^{-2}$ ,  $\phi_0 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} < 1 / \sqrt{|c|}$ , and  $1 / e < x_{\mathrm{end}} < e$ , respectively. In order to interpret them, it is interesting to use some approximations. From the trajectory (7.13), it is straightforward to calculate  $x_*$ . Recalling that inflation is supposed to stop at  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , one obtains  $x_* = \exp \left(e^{-c\Delta N_*}\ln x_{\mathrm{end}}\right)$ . Then, using Eqs. (7.8), (7.9) and (7.10) in the vacuum dominated limit, we find that

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \simeq \frac {c ^ {2}}{2} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2} \exp \left(2 \mathrm {e} ^ {- c \Delta N _ {*}} \ln x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}\right) e ^ {- 2 c \Delta N _ {*}} \ln^ {2} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}, \tag {7.14}
$$

$$
\epsilon_ {2 *} \simeq 2 c \left(1 + e ^ {- c \Delta N _ {*}} \ln x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}\right). \tag {7.15}
$$

In fact, in order to compare with the existing literature, it turns out to be convenient to define the following quantity

$$
s \equiv c \ln x _ {*} = - c e ^ {- c \Delta N _ {*}} \ln x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}. \tag {7.16}
$$

For RMI1 and RMI4,  $s > 0$  while for RMI2 and RMI3 one has  $s < 0$ . In terms of  $s$  Eqs. (7.14) and (7.15) can be re-written as

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \simeq \frac {s ^ {2}}{2} \left(\frac {\phi_ {0}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2} e ^ {- 2 s / c}, \quad \epsilon_ {2 *} \simeq 2 c \left(1 - \frac {s}{c}\right). \tag {7.17}
$$

These equations imply that the locus of the model predictions in the plane  $(\epsilon_{1},\epsilon_{2})$  are given by  $\epsilon_{2}\simeq 2(c - s) + 4\epsilon_{1}M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{2} / \phi_{0}^{2}$ . If we neglect  $\epsilon_{1*}$  (with respect to  $\epsilon_{2*}$ ) one recovers the formula derived in Refs. [673, 676, 678], namely  $n_{\mathrm{s}} - 1\simeq 2(s - c)$ . The same route for the third slow-roll parameter gives  $\epsilon_{2}\epsilon_{3}\simeq -2cs$  and neglecting again  $\epsilon_{1}$  gives the scalar running  $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\simeq 2sc$ . The above analytic estimates agree well with the complete slow-roll predictions represented in Figs. 323, 327, 331 and 335.

From the CMB normalization, we obtain the following expression for the mass scale

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} c ^ {2} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \frac {x _ {*} ^ {2} \ln^ {2} \left(x _ {*}\right)}{\left\{1 - \frac {c}{2} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left[ - \frac {1}{2} + \ln \left(x _ {*}\right) \right] x _ {*} ^ {2} \right\} ^ {3}}. \tag {7.18}
$$

In the vacuum dominated regime, this expression can be approximated by

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} \simeq 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} s ^ {2} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} e ^ {s / c}. \tag {7.19}
$$

One can then easily deduce the mass scale  $M$  for a given value of  $c$ ,  $\phi_0$  and  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , the three parameters of the model.
