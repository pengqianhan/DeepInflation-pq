# Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Inflation (SSBI)

# Theoretical Justifications

The potential that we study in this section is given by the following expression

$$
V (\phi) = V _ {0} + a \phi^ {2} + b \phi^ {4}, \tag {6.277}
$$

where  $a$  and  $b$  are constant coefficients the sign of which is not a priori determined. Before turning to the slow-roll analysis, it is interesting to study in which context such a potential can arise.

First of all, it is clear that this potential is very general since it is just made of the three first terms of a general Taylor expansion. Therefore, it can just be considered as a phenomenological description of a generic inflaton potential. This view was for instance adopted in Ref. [408], where this potential was used as a toy model to implement "new inflation". In the same fashion, it was also considered in Ref. [602] (with the assumptions  $a < 0$  and  $b > 0$ ) in the framework of models with spontaneous symmetry breaking where  $\phi$  represents one of the components of a Higgs field. In Ref. [603], it was also studied in the context of "mixmaster inflation".

However, there are also models where this specific shape explicitly arises and, here, when necessary, we also briefly review them.

The first example is given by Refs. [604, 605]. In these articles, inflation was investigated in the context of gauge mediated SUSY breaking scenarios. One of the basic idea of this approach is that the inflaton field should not be an extra field added to the theory on purpose but rather a field which is already present in known high energy theories. In the MSSM, see also section 5.17, we know that the Higgs sector superpotential contains the term  $\mu H_{\mathrm{u}}\cdot H_{\mathrm{d}}$  where  $\mu$  should be of the order of the electroweak scale, that is to say far from the Planck scale. This is the so-called  $\mu$ -problem. One possible solution is to consider that this term dynamically arises due to the presence of another superfield (usually a singlet),  $S$ , in the theory. Refs. [604, 605] take advantage of this fact and build a model where  $S$  can also play the role of the inflaton. Since the model is also formulated in the framework of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios, there is an additional superfield  $X$  such that its scalar component (also denoted  $X$ ) and auxiliary component  $F_{X}$  acquire non-vanishing vev. Let us now consider the following super-potential

$$
W = - \beta \frac {X S ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + \frac {S ^ {5}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + \lambda \frac {S ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} H _ {\mathrm {u}} \cdot H _ {\mathrm {d}} + \bar {W}, \tag {6.278}
$$

where the function  $\bar{W}$  describes all the other extra terms in  $W$  and, crucially, is assumed to be independent of  $S$ . The quantities  $\lambda$  and  $\beta$  are constant coefficients. As argued in Refs. [604, 605], this form of  $W$  can be enforced by discrete symmetries. In particular, we notice the absence of a term  $SH_{\mathrm{u}}\cdot H_{\mathrm{d}}$ . Another important ingredient of the model is the assumption that the vev  $F_{X}$  comes from the extra-terms in the above superpotential, i.e.  $F_{X}\simeq \partial \bar{W} /\partial X$ . Then, the scalar potential reads

$$
V = \left(F _ {X} - \beta \frac {S ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}\right) ^ {2} + \left(5 \frac {S ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} - 4 \beta \frac {X}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} S ^ {3}\right) ^ {2}. \tag {6.279}
$$

Taking into account supergravity corrections, which are typically of the form  $(\partial W / \partial X) / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2$  i.e.  $m^2 = aF_X^2 /M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2$ , where  $a$  is a coefficient of order one we are led to

$$
V \simeq F _ {X} ^ {2} - a \frac {F _ {X} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} S ^ {2} - 2 \beta F _ {X} \frac {S ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + 1 6 \beta^ {2} \frac {X ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} S ^ {6} - 4 0 \beta \frac {X}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} S ^ {7} + (2 5 + \beta^ {2}) \frac {S ^ {8}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}}. (6. 2 8 0)
$$

In addition, making the reasonable assumption that the field  $X$  is stabilized at a vev such that  $X / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \ll 1$ , one can neglect higher order terms in this expression. Then, we see that  $S$

can play the role of the inflaton with a potential of the form given by Eq. (6.277), namely

$$
V \simeq F _ {X} ^ {2} \left(1 - a \frac {S ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} - \frac {2 \beta M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{F _ {X}} \frac {S ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}}\right). \tag {6.281}
$$

At the minimum of the potential,  $S^4 \simeq M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 F_X$  and this implies a  $\mu$  term for the MSSM of the form  $\mu \simeq \lambda \sqrt{F_X}$ . As explained before, this model dynamically produces the  $\mu$  term while obtaining a candidate for the inflaton field. Finally, let us remark that the CMB normalization will determine the scale  $F_{X}$  and that the spectrum of the superparticles depends on the ratio  $F_{X} / X$ . Therefore, given a value of  $F_{X}$ , one can always choose  $X$  in order to obtain reasonable values for the superparticle masses.

The SSBI potential was also used, as a toy model, in Refs. [606, 607] to study a model of "Spinodal Inflation". After the 90's, it was considered again several times: in the context of the Randall-Sundrum model in Ref. [608] (but within the framework of Brans-Dicke theories), in the context of the little Higgs model in Ref. [337] and in the context of induced gravity inflation in Ref. [609]. In this last reference, a potential of the form (6.277) was considered but in the Jordan frame. Since the potential is different in the Einstein frame, in fact, this model does not belong to the class of scenarios studied here. Finally, it was also considered in the context of electroweak inflation in Ref. [610].

In Ref. [611], an inflationary scenario was studied in which the superpartner of the right-handed neutrino plays the role of the inflaton field. Let us denote by  $N$  the singlet neutrino superfield,  $\phi$  the super waterfall field (that can be put to zero during inflation) and  $S$  another singlet superfield (which can also be put to zero during inflation). Then, on very general grounds, the Kähler potential can be written as

$$
\begin{array}{l} K = | S | ^ {2} + | \phi | ^ {2} + | N | ^ {2} + \kappa_ {S} \frac {| S | ^ {4}}{4 M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + \kappa_ {N} \frac {| N | ^ {4}}{4 M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + \kappa_ {\phi} \frac {| \phi | ^ {4}}{4 M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + \kappa_ {S \phi} \frac {| S | ^ {2} | \phi | ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + \kappa_ {S N} \frac {| S | ^ {2} | N | ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \\ + \kappa_ {N \phi} \frac {\left| N \right| ^ {2} \left| \phi \right| ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + \dots , \tag {6.282} \\ \end{array}
$$

where the dimensionless coefficients  $\kappa$  are a priori of order one. The superpotential can be expressed as

$$
W = \kappa S \left(\frac {\phi^ {4}}{M ^ {\prime 2}} - M ^ {2}\right) + \frac {\lambda}{M _ {*}} N ^ {2} \phi^ {2} + \dots , \tag {6.283}
$$

where  $M$ ,  $M'$  and  $M_*$  are three mass scales and  $\kappa$  and  $\lambda$  are coupling constants. Since the three fields introduced before are singlets the potential does not contain  $D$ -term contributions. As a consequence, for  $S\simeq 0$  and  $\phi\simeq 0$ , we are left with the  $F$ -term potential only and this one can be written as

$$
V (N) \simeq \kappa^ {2} M ^ {4} \left[ 1 + \left(1 - \kappa_ {S N}\right) \frac {N ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + \left(\frac {1}{2} + \frac {\kappa_ {N}}{4} - \kappa_ {S N} + \kappa_ {S N} ^ {2}\right) \frac {N ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} + \dots \right]. \tag {6.284}
$$

We see that it has the form of Eq. (6.277). Ref. [611] also discusses how to stop inflation by tachyonic instability. Since the field  $\phi$  is viewed as the waterfall field, one has to calculate his mass to see when the instability is triggered. This can be done by evaluating the quadratic correction in  $\phi$  to the potential calculated before. This leads to

$$
m _ {\phi} ^ {2} = \left(1 + \kappa_ {N \phi} \frac {N ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} - \kappa_ {S \phi}\right) \frac {\kappa^ {2} M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} + 4 \frac {\lambda^ {2}}{M _ {*} ^ {2}} N ^ {4}. \tag {6.285}
$$

Neglecting the term  $N^2 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 \ll 1$  in this expression, the effective mass vanishes for

$$
N _ {\mathrm {c r i}} \simeq \frac {\kappa M ^ {2} M _ {*}}{2 \lambda M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} \sqrt {- (1 - \kappa_ {S \phi})}. \tag {6.286}
$$

We see that this requires  $1 - \kappa_{S\phi} < 0$ . On the other hand, this model also provides an expression for the coefficients  $a$  and  $b$  in terms of the fundamental coefficients of the Kähler potential. Except from the above mentioned condition, there is no other constraint on the coefficients  $\kappa$  and, as a consequence, the sign of  $a$  and  $b$  is, a priori, not fixed in this scenario.

Another context in which Eq. (6.277) arises is "racetrack inflation" [612, 613]. Racetrack inflation is a string inspired inflationary scenario where the inflaton is a volume modulus. Therefore, this model belongs to the same class as KMIII, see section 6.3. The Kähler and super potentials are given by standard formulas, namely

$$
K = - \frac {3}{\kappa} \ln \left(T + T ^ {\dagger}\right), \quad W = W _ {0} + A e ^ {- a T} + B e ^ {- b T}. \tag {6.287}
$$

Writing  $T = X + iY$ , it follows that the scalar  $F$ -term potential reduces to

$$
\begin{array}{l} V (X, Y) = \frac {\kappa}{6 X ^ {2}} \left\{a A ^ {2} (3 + a X) e ^ {- 2 a X} + b B ^ {2} (3 + b X) e ^ {- 2 b X} + 3 a A W _ {0} e ^ {- a X} \cos (a Y) \right. \\ \left. + 3 b B W _ {0} e ^ {- b X} \cos (b Y) + A B [ 2 a b X + 3 (a + b) ] e ^ {- (a + b) X} \cos [ (a - b) Y ] \right\} + \frac {E}{X ^ {\alpha}}, \tag {6.288} \\ \end{array}
$$

where an uplifting term  $\propto X^{-\alpha}$  has been added. Let us mention that  $X$  and  $Y$  are not canonically normalized and their kinetic term reads  $3[(\partial_{\mu}X)^{2} + (\partial_{\mu}Y)^{2}] / (4\kappa X^{2})$ . The above potential has a very rich structure and for  $W_0 = 0$  and  $a = b$ , we have a flat direction in  $Y$ . Moreover, for  $Y = 0$ , one can find a minimum in the  $X$  direction. If we then combine the two above remarks, then it is clear that there exists a choice of parameters such that one has a saddle point around  $Y = 0$  (a specific example was exhibited in Ref. [612]). This point seems suitable for inflation. Around such a point, it is argued in Ref. [613] that one can write

$$
V (Y) = V _ {0} \left(1 + \frac {\eta_ {0}}{2} y ^ {2} + \frac {C}{4} y ^ {4} + \dots\right), \tag {6.289}
$$

where  $y$  is now the canonically normalized field when  $X$  is stabilized. This is again a potential of the type given by Eq. (6.277). In order to phenomenologically reproduce racetrack inflation, one should have  $\eta_0$  small and negative and  $C$  large and positive.

The potential of Eq. (6.277) was also used, as a toy model, in the context of minimal left-right symmetric models with spontaneous  $D$ -parity breaking in Ref. [614] and in the context of hilltop supernatural inflation in Refs. [615-617]. A justification based on high energy physics was offered and the idea is to assume that the full potential has a SUSY flat direction. The approach is therefore similar to what was already investigated in section 5.17. In that situation, one can write  $V(\phi)$  as

$$
V = V _ {0} + \frac {1}{2} m ^ {2} \phi^ {2} - A \frac {\lambda_ {p} \phi^ {p}}{p M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {p - 3}} + \lambda_ {p} ^ {2} \frac {\phi^ {2 p - 2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2 p - 6}}, \tag {6.290}
$$

where the term  $V_{0}$  is added by hand. If one chooses  $p = 4$  and neglects the last term (for instance if  $\phi \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ ), then one arrives at

$$
V (\phi) \simeq V _ {0} + \frac {1}{2} m ^ {2} \phi^ {2} - \frac {\lambda_ {4} A}{4 M _ {\mathrm {P l}}} \phi^ {4}, \tag {6.291}
$$

which is of the form of Eq. (6.277). In this framework,  $m$  and  $A$  are SUSY soft terms and, therefore, should be taken of  $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$ . The term  $V_{0} = M_{\mathrm{s}}^{4}$  where  $M_{\mathrm{s}}$  is the SUSY breaking scale,  $M_{\mathrm{s}} \simeq 10^{11}\mathrm{GeV}$ .

Finally, let us mention that SSBI was also considered in the context of a supersymmetric  $B-L$  extension of the standard model in Refs. [618, 619] and in the context of Kähler-driven "tribrid inflation" in Ref. [620]. In this last case, one obtains a situation very similar to the one discussed above for sneutrino inflation. In particular, the coefficients  $a$  and  $b$  can be expressed in terms of the coefficients appearing in the Kähler potential. To end this part, let us notice that the potential (6.277) also arises in the context of Higgs inflation in a false vacuum, as shown in Refs. [621-623].

As already mentioned above, these works differ on the signs of  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$ . Summarizing, Refs. [603, 611] require  $\alpha > 0$ ,  $\beta > 0$  while Refs. [337, 408, 602, 606, 607, 609, 610, 613, 614] assume  $\alpha < 0$ ,  $\beta > 0$ . On the other hand, Refs. [615-617] consider that  $\alpha > 0$  and  $\beta < 0$  and Refs. [604, 605, 621-623] have  $\alpha < 0$ ,  $\beta < 0$ . We see that the four possible combinations have all been studied. Also, in Refs. [618, 619], one has  $\alpha, \beta \lesssim \mathcal{O}(1)$  and inflation only takes place in the increasing branches of the potential (see below). Finally, in Refs. [608, 620],  $\beta$  is taken to be positive and the sign of  $\alpha$  is left unspecified.

# Slow-Roll Analysis

Let us now turn to the slow-roll analysis of SSBI. For this purpose, it is more convenient to rewrite the potential (6.277) as

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ 1 + \alpha \left(\frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {2} + \beta \left(\frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} \right], \tag {6.292}
$$

where  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  are two dimensionless parameters. Based on the previous brief review of the literature, we conclude that it is necessary to study the model in full generality and, therefore, in what follows, we investigate all possible situations. As mentioned above, four cases should be distinguished:  $\alpha > 0$ ,  $\beta > 0$ ;  $\alpha < 0$ ,  $\beta < 0$ ;  $\alpha > 0$ ,  $\beta < 0$  and  $\alpha < 0$ ,  $\beta > 0$ , with two possible domains of inflation in the two latter cases. Therefore we have six regimes of inflation that we label SSBI1, SSBI2, SSBI3, SSBI4, SSBI5 and SSBI6. The different potentials and inflationary regimes are displayed and defined in Fig. 79 and Fig. 80. Since the potential is symmetric under  $\phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}} \rightarrow -\phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , it is only displayed and studied for  $\phi > 0$ .

Let us now calculate the slow-roll parameters. If one defines  $x$  by  $x \equiv \phi / M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , then the three first Hubble parameters are given by the following expressions

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {2 (\alpha x + 2 \beta x ^ {3}) ^ {2}}{(1 + \alpha x ^ {2} + \beta x ^ {4}) ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \frac {4 [ - \alpha + (\alpha^ {2} - 6 \beta) x ^ {2} + \alpha \beta x ^ {4} + 2 \beta^ {2} x ^ {6} ]}{(1 + \alpha x ^ {2} + \beta x ^ {4}) ^ {2}}, \tag {6.293}
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_ {3} = \frac {4 x ^ {2} (\alpha + 2 \beta x ^ {2}) [ - 3 \alpha^ {2} + 6 \beta + \alpha (\alpha^ {2} - 1 2 \beta) x ^ {2} + 3 (\alpha^ {2} - 8 \beta) \beta x ^ {4} + 2 \beta^ {3} x ^ {8} ]}{(1 + \alpha x ^ {2} + \beta x ^ {4}) ^ {2} [ - \alpha + (\alpha^ {2} - 6 \beta) x ^ {2} + \alpha \beta x ^ {4} + 2 \beta^ {2} x ^ {6} ]}. (6. 2 9 4)
$$

The first slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{1}$  is displayed in the right panels of Figs. 79 and 80 while the second and third slow-roll parameters  $\epsilon_{2}$  and  $\epsilon_{3}$  are displayed in Fig. 81. Let us describe the behavior of these slow-roll parameters, for the six models under consideration. For SSBI1,  $\epsilon_{1}$  vanishes at  $x = 0$ , reaches a maximum at  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^{\mathrm{SSBI1}}$  (where  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes and  $\epsilon_{3}$  diverges) and

then decreases to asymptotically vanish when  $x$  goes to infinity. The value of  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^{\mathrm{SSBI1}}$  is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {\mathrm {S S B I 1} \& 3 \& 6} = \left\{- \frac {\alpha}{6 \beta} + \frac {1}{6 \beta} \left[ 8 \alpha^ {3} + \sqrt {6 4 \alpha^ {6} + (5 \alpha^ {2} - 3 6 \beta) ^ {3}} \right] ^ {1 / 3} \right. \\ \left. + \frac {3 6 \beta - 5 \alpha^ {2}}{6 \beta} \left[ 8 \alpha^ {3} + \sqrt {6 4 \alpha^ {6} + (5 \alpha^ {2} - 3 6 \beta) ^ {3}} \right] ^ {- 1 / 3} \right\} ^ {1 / 2}. \tag {6.295} \\ \end{array}
$$

Whether the maximum of  $\epsilon_{1}$  at this point is larger or smaller than 1 depends on  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$ . In the following, we restrict ourselves to the physical regime where  $\alpha, \beta \lesssim \mathcal{O}(1)$ . For each value of  $\beta$ , there is a minimum value of  $\alpha$ , denoted  $\alpha_{\mathrm{min}}$ , above which the maximum is larger than 1. The line  $\alpha_{\mathrm{min}}(\beta)$  is displayed in Fig. 82 and the shaded area in this plot represents the region in the parameter space where inflation stops by slow-roll violation. When  $\beta \ll 1$ ,  $\alpha_{\mathrm{min}}(\beta)$  approaches 2 as can be noticed in the figure. In addition, for  $\beta \gtrsim 0.25$ , the maximum value for  $\epsilon_{1}$  becomes larger than 1 for any value of  $\alpha$ .

For SSBI2, the three first slow-roll parameters are monotonic increasing functions of

the field  $vev$  and diverge when the potential vanishes at

$$
x _ {V = 0} ^ {\mathrm {S S B I 2 \& 4 \& 5}} = \sqrt {- \frac {\alpha + \sqrt {\alpha^ {2} - 4 \beta}}{2 \beta}}. \tag {6.296}
$$

Hence inflation ends by slow-roll violation at  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . Unfortunately, the corresponding  $vev$  cannot be found exactly and one has to rely on numerical calculations. Let us also notice that, while the first and third slow-roll parameters  $\epsilon_1$  and  $\epsilon_3$  vanish at  $x = 0$ ,  $\epsilon_2$  is equal to  $\epsilon_2^{\min} = -4\alpha$  at this point. Therefore, in order for the slow-roll approximation to be valid, one needs to work with  $|\alpha| \ll 1$ .

For SSBI3, the first slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{1}$  vanishes at  $x = 0$  and at  $x = \sqrt{-\alpha / (2\beta)}$ . In between, it reaches a maximum located at

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {\mathrm {S S B I 3}} = x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {\mathrm {S S B I 1}}, \tag {6.297}
$$

a point where  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes and  $\epsilon_{3}$  diverges. Whether the maximum of  $\epsilon_{1}$  at this point is larger or smaller than 1 depends again on  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$ . For each value of  $\beta$ , there is a minimum value for  $\alpha$  above which inflation stops by slow-roll violation, similarly to the SSBI1 case. This corresponds to the green dotted line in Fig. 82 (top right panel). One way to estimate

whether a slow roll regime of inflation can occur in the decreasing branch of  $\epsilon_{1}$  is to look at the value of  $\epsilon_{2}$  at the top of the potential. It is given by

$$
\epsilon_ {2} ^ {\mathrm {t o p}} = \frac {- 3 2 \alpha \beta}{\alpha^ {2} - 4 \beta}. \tag {6.298}
$$

This number is smaller than one when  $\beta < -1/64$ , or when  $\alpha$  lies outside the range with limits given by  $-16\beta \pm \sqrt{\beta(1 + 64\beta)}$ , displayed in Fig. 82 with the red and cyan dotted lines. Therefore, requiring that  $\epsilon_2^{\mathrm{top}} < 1$  and that inflation stops by slow roll violation leads to the allowed space  $\alpha > \alpha_{\mathrm{min}}$ , represented by the shaded region in Fig. 82.

For SSBI4, the three first slow-roll parameters are monotonic increasing functions of the field  $vev$  and diverge when the potential vanishes at  $x_{V=0}^{\mathrm{SSBI2\& 4}}$ . The first and third slow-roll parameters  $\epsilon_1$  and  $\epsilon_3$  vanish when  $x = \sqrt{-\alpha/(2\beta)}$  while  $\epsilon_2$  has a non-zero value  $\epsilon_2^{\min} = 8\alpha\beta / (\beta^2 - \alpha^2/4)$  at this point. From the above discussion, it is clear that, in this version of the scenario, inflation also stops by violation of the slow-roll condition. As for SSBI2, however, the corresponding  $vev$  cannot be determined exactly and a numerical calculation is needed.

For SSBI5, the behavior of the slow-roll parameters depend on  $\alpha^2/\beta$ . If  $\alpha^2/\beta \geq 4$ , the minimum of the potential at  $x = \sqrt{-\alpha/(2\beta)}$  is negative. The potential vanishes at  $x_{V=0}^{\mathrm{SSBI2\&4\&5}}$  and the three first slow-roll parameters continuously increase between  $x = 0$  where

they vanish (except  $\epsilon_{2}$  for which  $\epsilon_{2}^{\mathrm{min}} = -4\alpha$ ) and  $x_{V=0}^{\mathrm{SSBI2\&4\&5}}$  where they diverge. Inflation ends by slow-roll violation at some point  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  that needs to be determined numerically. On the other hand, if  $\alpha^{2}/\beta \leq 4$ ,  $\epsilon_{1}$  vanishes at  $x = 0$ , reaches a maximum at  $x_{\epsilon_{2}=0}^{\mathrm{SSBI5}}$  (where  $\epsilon_{2}$  vanishes and  $\epsilon_{3}$  diverges), then decreases and finally vanishes at  $x = \sqrt{-\alpha/(2\beta)}$ . The value of  $x_{\epsilon_{2}=0}^{\mathrm{SSBI5}}$  is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {\mathrm {S S B I 5}} = \left\{- \frac {\alpha}{6 \beta} - \frac {1 + i \sqrt {3}}{1 2 \beta} \left[ 8 \alpha^ {3} + \sqrt {6 4 \alpha^ {6} + (5 \alpha^ {2} - 3 6 \beta) ^ {3}} \right] ^ {1 / 3} \right. \\ \left. + \frac {5 \alpha^ {2} - 3 6 \beta}{1 2 \beta} (1 - i \sqrt {3}) \left[ 8 \alpha^ {3} + \sqrt {6 4 \alpha^ {6} + (5 \alpha^ {2} - 3 6 \beta) ^ {3}} \right] ^ {- 1 / 3} \right\} ^ {1 / 2}. \tag {6.299} \\ \end{array}
$$

Whether the maximum of  $\epsilon_{1}$  at this point is larger or smaller than 1 depends on  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$

and is again similar to what has already been discussed before. The region in the parameter space where inflation ends by slow-roll violation is displayed in Fig. 82 and corresponds to the points such that  $\alpha < -|\alpha_{\mathrm{min}}|$ . In this plot, the dotted line represents the curve  $\alpha^2 = 4\beta$ , above which one is sure that inflation ends by slow-roll violation since the minimum of the potential is negative in this case. For values of  $\beta \ll 1$ , one can see that  $|\alpha_{\mathrm{min}}| \simeq 2\sqrt{\beta}$  and the allowed region becomes negligible.

Finally the case SSBI6 remains to be treated. The behavior of the slow roll parameters depend on  $\alpha^2/\beta$  in the same way as before. If  $\alpha^2/\beta \geq 4$ , the minimum of the potential at  $x = \sqrt{-\alpha/(2\beta)}$  is negative. The potential vanishes at  $x_{V=0}^{\mathrm{SSBI6}}$  and the slow-roll parameters continuously decrease from this value (where they blow up) and go to zero at infinity. The value of  $x_{V=0}^{\mathrm{SSBI6}}$  can be expressed as

$$
x _ {V = 0} ^ {\mathrm {S S B I 6}} = \sqrt {\frac {- \alpha + \sqrt {\alpha^ {2} - 4 \beta}}{2 \beta}}. \tag {6.300}
$$

On the other hand, if  $\alpha^2 /\beta \leq 4$ ,  $\epsilon_{1}$  vanishes at  $x = \sqrt{-\alpha / (2\beta)}$ , reaches a maximum at  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^{\mathrm{SSBI6}}$  and then decreases. At infinity, it goes to zero. The value of  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 0}^{\mathrm{SSBI6}}$  is given by

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {\mathrm {S S B I 6}} = x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {\mathrm {S S B I 3}} = x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 0} ^ {\mathrm {S S B I 1}}. \tag {6.301}
$$

Whether the maximum of  $\epsilon_{1}$  at this point is larger or smaller than 1 depends on  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$ . The corresponding region in the parameter space is displayed in Fig. 82 and corresponds to the inequality  $\alpha < -|\alpha_{\mathrm{min}}|$ . The dotted line represents the law  $\alpha^2 = 4\beta$ . Above this line, one is sure that inflation can stop by slow-roll violation since, in this case, the potential becomes negative at some point. It is also interesting to notice that, when  $\beta \gtrsim 1.48$ , the maximum value of  $\epsilon_{1}$  is larger than 1 for any value of  $\alpha$ . On the other hand, if  $\beta \ll 1$ , the allowed region shrinks to zero.

Let us now turn to the slow-roll trajectory. This one can be integrated analytically to get

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = - \frac {1}{2 \alpha} \ln \left(\frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{x}\right) - \frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} - x ^ {2}}{8} - \frac {\alpha^ {2} - 4 \beta}{1 6 \alpha \beta} \ln \left(\frac {1 + \frac {2 \beta}{\alpha} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}}{1 + \frac {2 \beta}{\alpha} x ^ {2}}\right), \qquad (6. 3 0 2)
$$

where  $N_{\mathrm{end}}$  is the number of  $e$ -folds at the end of inflation. It is important to notice that the argument of the logarithm is always positive. This trajectory cannot be inverted analytically. But, numerically, it is easy to use this expression in order to determine  $x_*$ , the value of  $x$  at Hubble radius crossing.

Finally, it is interesting to constrain the value of the scale  $M$  with the CMB normalization. It follows that

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = \frac {2 8 8 0 \left(\alpha x _ {*} + 2 \beta x _ {*} ^ {3}\right) ^ {2} \pi^ {2}}{\left(1 + \alpha x _ {*} ^ {2} + \beta x _ {*} ^ {4}\right) ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.303}
$$

We are now in a position where we can discuss the predictions of the six versions of this model. The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the SSBI1 models are displayed in Figs. 231, 232 and 233 for  $\beta = 10^{-3}$ ,  $\beta = 10^{-1}$  and  $\beta = 10$ , respectively. SSBI1 seems to be disfavored by the observations. The predictions of SSBI2 models are displayed in Fig. 234 for

different values of  $\beta$  and  $\alpha$ . We notice that they depend on the parameter  $\alpha$  quite strongly. The spectral index is clearly red and, for values of  $\beta$  of order one, the contribution of gravity waves becomes very small. For SSBI3, the predictions are presented in Figs. 238, 239 and 240 for  $\beta = -10^{-3}$ ,  $\beta = -5\times 10^{-3}$  and  $\beta = -10^{-2}$ , respectively. As we increase  $\beta$ , the points start spreading in the plane  $(n_{\mathrm{s}},r)$ . For this class of models, the spectrum is red and the level of gravity waves quite important. The predictions for the SSBI4 models are displayed in Figs. 241, 242, and 243 for  $\beta = -10^{-5}$ ,  $\beta = -10^{-4}$ ,  $\beta = -10^{-3}$ , respectively. One can notice that the typical predicted values for  $\epsilon_{1}$  decrease with the absolute value of  $\beta$ . As before the spread of the points increases with  $\beta$ . The tilt is still red and the contribution of gravity waves is small for small values of  $\alpha$ . The predictions for the SSBI5 models are displayed in Figs. 244, 245 and 246 for  $\beta = 10^{-6}$ ,  $\beta = 10^{-5}$  and  $\beta = 10^{-4}$ , respectively. Once again, for  $\mathcal{O}(1)$  values of  $\beta$ , one can see that the model predicts a small amount of gravitational waves but has a deviation from scale invariance strongly disfavored by the observational constraints. Finally, the reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the SSBI6 models are displayed in Figs. 247, 248 and 249 for  $\beta = 10^{-6}$ ,  $\beta = 10^{-1}$  and  $\beta = 1$ , respectively. When  $\beta \ll 1$  the predictions of the model do not depend on  $\beta$ . Moreover, for values of  $\beta$  of order one, the predictions become almost independent of the two parameters of the model.
