# Superconformal  $\alpha$ -Attractor B Inflation (SABI)

# Theoretical Justifications

In this section, we consider a generalization of the "T-models" (TMI, see section 5.30), which leads to another family of  $\alpha$ -attractor models. The idea is to introduce a new embedding

Kähler potential and a new superconformal superpotential given by

$$
\mathcal {N} \left(X ^ {I}, \bar {X} ^ {\bar {I}}\right) = - \left| X ^ {0} \right| ^ {2} \left[ 1 - \frac {\left| X ^ {1} \right| ^ {2} + | S | ^ {2}}{| X ^ {0} | ^ {2}} + 3 \zeta \frac {| S | ^ {4}}{| X ^ {0} | ^ {2} \left(| X ^ {0} | ^ {2} - | X ^ {1} | ^ {2}\right)} \right] ^ {\alpha}, \tag {6.487}
$$

$$
\mathcal {W} = S \left(X ^ {0}\right) ^ {2} f \left(\frac {X ^ {1}}{X ^ {0}}\right) \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(X ^ {1}\right) ^ {2}}{\left(X ^ {0}\right) ^ {2}} \right] ^ {\frac {3 \alpha - 1}{2}}. \tag {6.488}
$$

The field content of the model is the same as for the TMI model, namely a conformon  $X^0$ , the inflaton  $X^1 = \Phi$  and a Goldstino  $X^3 = S$ . As before, the term proportional to the parameter  $\zeta$  is introduced to make sure that the inflationary trajectory is stable.

The main new aspect of the model is the presence of the parameter  $\alpha$ . For  $\alpha = 1$ , one recovers the embedding Kähler potential (5.472) and the superconformal superpotential (5.473). Then, the conformal symmetry is fixed by choosing  $X^0 = \bar{X}^0 = \sqrt{3} M_{\mathrm{g}}$  and, using Eq. (4.42), one obtains the Kähler and superpotential, namely

$$
K = - 3 \alpha M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2} \ln (1 + k), \tag {6.489}
$$

$$
W = 3 M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2} S f \left(\frac {\Phi}{\sqrt {3} M _ {\mathrm {g}}}\right) \left(1 - \frac {\Phi^ {2}}{3 M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}}\right) ^ {\frac {3 \alpha - 1}{2}}, \tag {6.490}
$$

where the function  $k$  has already been defined in Eq. (5.475). Compared to the Kähler potential of TMI, section 5.30, we see that it is still given by a logarithm of the function  $1 + k$  but, now, multiplied by the parameter  $\alpha$ .

From the above expressions of  $K$  and  $W$ , one can then calculate the kinetic term and the potential of the inflaton field. As done in section 5.30, this calculation is carried out along the inflationary trajectory  $S = 0$ . One obtains

$$
G _ {A \bar {B}} = - \frac {3 \alpha}{1 + k} \frac {\partial^ {2} k}{\partial X ^ {A} \partial \bar {X} ^ {\bar {B}}} + \frac {3 \alpha}{(1 + k) ^ {2}} \frac {\partial k}{\partial X ^ {A}} \frac {\partial k}{\partial \bar {X} ^ {\bar {B}}}, \tag {6.491}
$$

that is to say

$$
G _ {A \bar {B}} = \frac {\alpha}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2} (1 + k) ^ {2}} \left( \begin{array}{c c} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 + k \end{array} \right). \tag {6.492}
$$

These two expressions are the generalization of Eqs. (5.481) and (5.482). One immediately deduces that the canonically normalized inflaton field  $\varphi$  can be expressed in terms of  $\Phi$  in the following way

$$
\Phi = \sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {g}} \tanh \left(\frac {\varphi}{\sqrt {6 \alpha} M _ {\mathrm {g}}}\right), (6. 4 9 3)
$$

and this expression should be compared to its TMI's counterpart in Eq. (5.483). Finally, by using Eq. (5.480), the potential of the canonically normalized field  $\varphi$  can be derived and one obtains

$$
V (\varphi) = 9 M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {4} \left| f \left[ \tanh  \left(\frac {\varphi}{\sqrt {6 \alpha} M _ {\mathrm {g}}}\right) \right] \right| ^ {2}. \tag {6.494}
$$

As a consequence, one obtains a potential which resembles a lot the potential of the T-models, the difference being that the argument of the function  $f$  now involves  $\varphi / (\sqrt{6\alpha} M_{\mathrm{g}})$

instead of  $\varphi / (\sqrt{6} M_{\mathrm{g}})$ . We have therefore obtained a mixed model, combining aspects of the T-model with aspects of the  $\alpha$ -attractor.

In order to have an explicit potential, one must choose the function  $f$ , which is equivalent to the choice of the function  $F_{\mathrm{T}}(.)$  in section 5.30. As noticed in sections 4.1.2 and 5.30, the choice  $F_{\mathrm{T}}(\phi / \chi) = (\phi / \chi)^{2} / (1 + \phi / \chi)^{2}$  leads to the Starobinsky model for  $\alpha = 1$ . If  $\alpha \neq 1$ , this leads to an alternative derivation of the  $\alpha$ -attractor model, as mentioned at the end of section 5.29. One can also choose the more general form

$$
F _ {\mathrm {T}} \left(\frac {\phi}{\chi}\right) = \left(\frac {\phi / \chi}{1 + \phi / \chi}\right) ^ {2 n}, \tag {6.495}
$$

where  $n$  is a new free index. This leads to the potential

$$
V (\phi) = 9 M ^ {4} \left[ \frac {\tanh \left(\frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} \sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right)}{1 + \tanh \left(\frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} \sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right)} \right] ^ {2 n}, \tag {6.496}
$$

Clearly, this potential is a direct generalization of the  $\alpha$ -attractor potential of section 5.29.

# Slow-roll Analysis

As explained in the previous section, the potential of the SABI model depends on two parameters,  $\alpha$  and  $n$ , and can also be written as (we have redefined the scale  $M$ )

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left(1 - e ^ {- \sqrt {\frac {2}{3 \alpha}} x}\right) ^ {2 n}, \tag {6.497}
$$

where  $x = \phi / M_{\mathrm{g}}$ . For  $n = 1$ , one recovers the  $\alpha$ -attractor model, see section 5.29, and for  $n = 1$  and  $\alpha = 1$ , one has the Starobinsky model, see section 4.1. These models may also be referred to as  $\alpha$ -attractor E models in the literature. The potential (6.497) is represented in Fig. 98 for different values of  $\alpha$  and  $n$ . Since after inflation the field settles at the minimum of the potential where it vanishes, the numerical value of  $M_{\mathrm{g}} \simeq M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ .

The three Hubble flow functions are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {4 n ^ {2}}{3 \alpha \left(e ^ {\sqrt {\frac {2}{3 \alpha}} x} - 1\right) ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \frac {2 n}{3 \alpha \left[ \sinh \left(\frac {x}{\sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right) \right] ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {3} = \frac {4 n}{3 \alpha \tanh  \left(\frac {x}{\sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right) \left(e ^ {\sqrt {\frac {2}{3 \alpha}} x} - 1\right)}. \tag {6.498}
$$

Evidently, when  $\alpha = 1$  and  $n = 1$ , these expressions reduce to Eqs. (4.48) while if  $n = 1$  (and  $\alpha$  unspecified), one recovers the expressions of the Hubble flow functions given in section 5.29. The Hubble flow functions have been represented in the lower panels of Fig. 98.

In this scenario inflation gracefully ends when  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$ , at a field value  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  given by

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} = \sqrt {\frac {3 \alpha}{2}} \ln \left(1 + \frac {2 n}{\sqrt {3 \alpha}}\right). \tag {6.499}
$$

However, as it was the case for Higgs inflation in section 4.2, and also for the  $\alpha$ -attractor scenario (see section 5.29), violation of the slow-roll conditions can occur before. The value

of the field for which  $\epsilon_{2} = 1$  can be expressed as

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {2} = 1} = \sqrt {6 \alpha} \operatorname {a r c s i n h} \left(\sqrt {\frac {2 n}{3 \alpha}}\right), \tag {6.500}
$$

and the field value for which  $\epsilon_3 = 1$  is

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {3} = 1} = \sqrt {6 \alpha} \operatorname {a r c t a n h} \left(\frac {2}{1 + \sqrt {1 + 6 \alpha / n}}\right). \tag {6.501}
$$

In the case of the  $\alpha$ -attractor model, regardless of the value of  $\alpha$ , the field reaches first the value  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 1}$ , then  $x_{\epsilon_3 = 1}$  and, finally,  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . It is interesting to notice that, here, this hierarchy does no longer exist: when the parameter  $n$  is changed, the field value can reach  $x_{\epsilon_2 = 1}$  before inflation stops, or not.

The slow-roll trajectory can be analytically derived and reads

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = \frac {1}{2 n} \sqrt {\frac {3 \alpha}{2}} (x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - x) + \frac {3 \alpha}{4 n} \left(e ^ {\sqrt {\frac {2}{3 \alpha}} x} - e ^ {\sqrt {\frac {2}{3 \alpha}} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}\right). (6. 5 0 2)
$$

As it was the case for the  $\alpha$ -attractor model, this trajectory can be inverted and expressed in terms of the “-1-branch” of the Lambert function  $W_{-1}$ . One finds

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = \sqrt {\frac {3 \alpha}{2}} \left\{- \frac {4 n}{3 \alpha} \Delta N + \sqrt {\frac {2}{3 \alpha}} x _ {\text {e n d}} - e ^ {\sqrt {\frac {2}{3 \alpha}} x _ {\text {e n d}}} \right. \tag {6.503} \\ - \left. \mathrm {W} _ {- 1} \left[ - \exp \left(- \frac {4 n}{3 \alpha} \Delta N + \sqrt {\frac {2}{3 \alpha}} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - e ^ {\sqrt {\frac {2}{3 \alpha}} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}\right) \right] \right\}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where, as usual,  $\Delta N = N_{\mathrm{end}} - N$ . The reason that inflation proceeds along the  $-1$  branch of the Lambert function has already been explained in section 5.29.

Finally, the value of  $x_{*}$ , at which the pivot mode crossed out the Hubble radius during inflation can be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{l} x _ {*} = \sqrt {\frac {3 \alpha}{2}} \left[ - \frac {4 n}{3 \alpha} \Delta N _ {*} + \ln \left(1 + \frac {2 n}{\sqrt {3 \alpha}}\right) - \left(1 + \frac {2 n}{\sqrt {3 \alpha}}\right) \right] \tag {6.504} \\ - \sqrt {\frac {3 \alpha}{2}} \mathrm {W} _ {- 1} \left\{- \exp \left[ - \frac {4 n}{3 \alpha} \Delta N _ {*} + \ln \left(1 + \frac {2 n}{\sqrt {3 \alpha}}\right) - \left(1 + \frac {2 n}{\sqrt {3 \alpha}}\right) \right] \right\}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where, in this expression, we have used the value of  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  derived above. From the knowledge of  $x_*$ , the energy scale  $M$  of the potential can be inferred and one obtains

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {4}} = \frac {1 9 2 0 \pi^ {2} n ^ {2}}{\alpha} \left(1 - e ^ {- \sqrt {\frac {2}{3 \alpha}} x _ {*}}\right) ^ {- 2 (n + 1)} e ^ {- 2 \sqrt {\frac {2}{3 \alpha}} x _ {*}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s} - \mathrm {P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.505}
$$
