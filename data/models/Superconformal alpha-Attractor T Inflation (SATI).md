# Superconformal  $\alpha$ -Attractor T Inflation (SATI)

These models have been discussed in Ref. [541]. In section 6.29, we have seen how to generate a class of potentials that depend on  $\tanh[\phi/(M_{\mathrm{g}}\sqrt{6\alpha})]$ , see Eq. (6.494). The precise shape of the potential then depends on an arbitrary function  $f \sim F_{\mathrm{T}}(\cdot)$ . A specific choice was made in section 6.29 for this function and, here, we study another choice. In fact, this choice of  $F_{\mathrm{T}}(\cdot)$  was already considered in Eq. (5.471) and is just a power-law. This directly leads to the SATI potential

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ \tanh  \left(\frac {\phi}{\sqrt {6 \alpha} M _ {\mathrm {g}}}\right) \right] ^ {2 n}, \tag {6.506}
$$

which represents a generalization of the TMI model discussed in section 5.30. It describes a two parameters model with  $\alpha$  and  $n$ , matching TMI for  $\alpha = 1$ .

Defining  $x \equiv \phi / M_{\mathrm{g}}$ , one obtains the Hubble flow functions

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {4 n ^ {2}}{3 \alpha} \sinh^ {- 2} \left(\frac {2 x}{\sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right), \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \frac {8 n}{3 \alpha} \frac {\cosh \left(\frac {2 x}{\sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right)}{\sinh^ {2} \left(\frac {2 x}{\sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right)}, \quad \epsilon_ {3} = \frac {2 n}{3 \alpha} \frac {3 + \cosh \left(\frac {4 x}{\sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right)}{\sinh^ {2} \left(\frac {2 x}{\sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right) \cosh \left(\frac {2 x}{\sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right)}. \tag {6.507}
$$

For  $\alpha = 1$ , one can check that the Hubble flow function of the TMI model of section 5.30 are recovered. The potential, its logarithm and the the Hubble flow functions have been plotted

in Fig. 99 as a function of  $x$ . The field value after inflation is expected to be at the minimum of the potential and vanishing. As a result, the numerical value of  $M_{\mathrm{g}} \simeq M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ .

In this scenario, as shown in Fig. 99 (bottom left panel), the first slow-roll parameter increases as the vacuum expectation of the field decreases and this implies that inflation stops by violation of the slow-roll conditions, when  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$ . The corresponding vacuum expectation value of the field reads

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} = \frac {\sqrt {6 \alpha}}{2} \operatorname {a r c s i n h} \left(\frac {2 n}{\sqrt {3 \alpha}}\right). \tag {6.508}
$$

The slow-roll trajectory can be integrated exactly and one obtains

$$
N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N = \frac {3 \alpha}{4 n} \left[ \cosh \left(\frac {2 x}{\sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right) - \cosh \left(\frac {2 x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}{\sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right) \right]. (6. 5 0 9)
$$

This formula can be inverted analytically and, as a consequence,  $\phi /M_{\mathrm{g}}$  during slow-roll inflation can be expressed as

$$
x = \frac {\sqrt {6 \alpha}}{2} \operatorname {a r c c o s h} \left(\sqrt {1 + \frac {4 n ^ {2}}{3 \alpha}} + \frac {4 n}{3 \alpha} \Delta N\right), \tag {6.510}
$$

where  $\Delta N = N_{\mathrm{end}} - N$ . The value of  $x_*$  is just given by the above expression with  $\Delta N = \Delta N_*$ . Again, one verifies that the above formulas are equivalent to those presented in section 5.30 when  $\alpha = 1$ .

Finally, the mass scale  $M$  that normalizes the potential can be expressed as

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {4}} = \frac {1 9 2 0 \pi^ {2} n ^ {2}}{\alpha \sinh^ {2} \left(\frac {2 x _ {*}}{\sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right) \left[ \tanh \left(\frac {x _ {*}}{\sqrt {6 \alpha}}\right) \right] ^ {2 n}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. (6. 5 1 1)
$$

The reheating consistent observable predictions for SATI have been represented in Figs. 320 to 322 for various values of  $n$  and  $\alpha$ . As before, one notices that the dependence of the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio with respect to  $n$  are very small. Indeed, if  $n\Delta N$  dominates in Eq. (6.510), one obtains

$$
x _ {*} \simeq \frac {\sqrt {6 \alpha}}{2} \operatorname {a r c c o s h} \left(\frac {4 n}{3 \alpha} \Delta N _ {*}\right). (6. 5 1 2)
$$

Plugging this approximation into Eqs. (6.507) gives

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \simeq \frac {3 \alpha}{4 \Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2 *} \simeq \frac {2}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \quad \epsilon_ {3 *} \simeq \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \tag {6.513}
$$

and the Hubble-flow functions are independent of  $n$  in the large  $\Delta N_*$  limit. However, one notices that  $\epsilon_{1*}$  retains a dependence in  $\alpha$  while the two other Hubble flow parameters remains unaffected.

The reheating consistent slow-roll prediction for Superconformal  $\alpha$ -attractor T Inflation have been represented in Figs. 320 to 322.
