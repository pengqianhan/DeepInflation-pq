# T-Model Inflation (TMI)

# Theoretical Justifications

The theoretical motivations underlying these scenarios, which were named "T-models" in Ref. [262], find their roots in the superconformal context already presented for Starobinsky Inflation (SI) in section 4.1.2. As discussed in that section, the corresponding scenarios have some attractive features. In particular, they are conformally and  $\mathrm{SO}(1,1)$  invariant. If the conformal invariance is broken in the rapidity gauge,  $\chi^2 -\phi^2 = 6$ , it was shown that the model reduces to the standard action of a scalar field, minimally coupled to gravity, with a constant potential, see Eq. (4.39). The corresponding solution is de Sitter spacetime, thus showing a connection between the action of Eq. (4.35) and the theory of inflation. Let us add that the way conformal invariance is broken is a choice and other instances are possible, but leading to the same conclusions. For instance, the conformal gauge  $\chi = \sqrt{6}$  is a good illustration of the above claim since it is particularly simple. Indeed, in that case, the action (4.35) takes the form

$$
S \left(g _ {\mu \nu}, \phi\right) = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}}{2} \int \mathrm {d} ^ {4} x \sqrt {- g} \left[ \left(1 - \frac {\phi^ {2}}{6}\right) R - g ^ {\mu \nu} \partial_ {\mu} \phi \partial_ {\nu} \phi - \frac {\lambda}{2} (\phi^ {2} - 6) ^ {2} \right]. (5. 4 6 5)
$$

Using the notations presented in section 4.2.1, while dropping the "bar" over Jordan frame quantities here, we see that this is the action of a scalar tensor theory with  $F(\phi) = 1 - \phi^2 /6$ ,  $Z(\phi) = 1$  and  $U = \lambda (\phi^{2} - 6)^{2} / 4$ , see Eq. (4.72). Expressed in the Einstein frame, the action exactly reduces to Eq. (4.39) since the potential reads  $V = M_{\mathrm{g}}^{2}U / F^{2} = 9\lambda M_{\mathrm{g}}^{2}$ . Theferore, this

confirms that the final result is the same regardless of the gauge is used to break conformal invariance.

The above preliminary considerations help us to understand the context in which the TMI model is designed. Indeed, let us now consider the following action which is a generalization of the Eq. (4.35),

$$
\begin{array}{l} S \left(g _ {\mu \nu}, \chi , \phi\right) = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}}{2} \int \mathrm {d} ^ {4} x \sqrt {- g} \left[ \frac {\chi^ {2}}{6} R + g ^ {\mu \nu} \partial_ {\mu} \chi \partial_ {\nu} \chi - \frac {\phi^ {2}}{6} R - g ^ {\mu \nu} \partial_ {\mu} \phi \partial_ {\nu} \phi \right. \\ \left. - \frac {1}{3 6} F _ {\mathrm {T}} \left(\frac {\phi}{\chi}\right) \left(\phi^ {2} - \chi^ {2}\right) ^ {2} \right], \tag {5.466} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $F_{\mathrm{T}}(.)$ , the new ingredient of the model, is a priori an arbitrary function. Given that  $F_{\mathrm{T}} = 1$  leads to de Sitter, deviations from this case should lead to non-trivial models of inflation. It is also important to notice that the action (5.466) is still conformally invariant, thanks to the dependence of  $F_{\mathrm{T}}(.)$  in  $\phi / \chi$ . However, the symmetry  $\mathrm{SO}(1,1)$  is broken, unless  $F_{\mathrm{T}}$  is a constant which was of course precisely the case in Eq. (4.35). Notice also that, in section 4.1, it was shown that the above model with a term  $\sim \phi^2 (\phi - \chi)^2$ , or, equivalently,  $F_{\mathrm{T}} \sim (\phi / \chi)^2 / (1 + \phi / \chi)^2$  leads to the Starobinsky model. This important model is therefore included in the class of models studied in this section.

Then, in order to proceed, one needs to choose a gauge. Taking  $\chi = \sqrt{6}$ , Eq. (5.466) takes the form

$$
S \left(g _ {\mu \nu}, \chi , \phi\right) = \frac {M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}}{2} \int \mathrm {d} ^ {4} x \sqrt {- g} \left[ \left(1 - \frac {\phi^ {2}}{6}\right) R - g ^ {\mu \nu} \partial_ {\mu} \phi \partial_ {\nu} \phi - \frac {1}{3 6} F _ {\mathrm {T}} \left(\frac {\phi}{\sqrt {6}}\right) \left(\phi^ {2} - 6\right) ^ {2} \right]. \tag {5.467}
$$

Again, one recognizes a scalar tensor theory with  $F(\phi) = 1 - \phi^2 /6$ ,  $Z(\phi) = 1$  and  $2U = F_{\mathrm{T}}(\phi /\sqrt{6})(\phi^{2} / 6 - 1)^{2}$ . The potential,  $V = M_{\mathrm{g}}^{2}U / F^{2}$ , is then given by  $V = M_{\mathrm{g}}^{2}F_{\mathrm{T}}(\phi /\sqrt{6}) / 2$ . In addition, the relationship between the fields  $\phi$  and  $\tilde{\phi}$  is given by Eq. (4.74) and leads to

$$
\frac {\tilde {\phi}}{M _ {\mathrm {g}}} = - \sqrt {\frac {3}{2}} \ln \left(\frac {\sqrt {6} - \phi}{\sqrt {6} + \phi}\right). \tag {5.468}
$$

This relation can be inverted and one arrives at

$$
\phi = \sqrt {6} \tanh  \left(\frac {\tilde {\phi}}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} \sqrt {6}}\right). \tag {5.469}
$$

As a consequence, in the Einstein frame, the action takes the form

$$
S \left(\tilde {g} _ {\mu \nu}, \tilde {\phi}\right) = \int \mathrm {d} ^ {4} x \sqrt {- \tilde {g}} \left\{\frac {M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}}{2} \tilde {R} - \frac {1}{2} \tilde {g} ^ {\mu \nu} \partial_ {\mu} \tilde {\phi} \partial_ {\nu} \tilde {\phi} - \frac {M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}}{2} F _ {\mathrm {T}} \left[ \tanh  \left(\frac {\tilde {\phi}}{\sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {g}}}\right) \right] \right\}. (5. 4 7 0)
$$

One can also use the rapidity condition  $\chi^2 -\phi^2 = 6$ . Then, using the parametrization defined in Eq. (4.38) for this gauge, one can check that the action (5.470) is directly recovered.

The next question is of course which function  $F_{\mathrm{T}}(.)$  should be chosen? In absence of any deep reasons, Ref. [262] argues that a reasonable and interesting choice is simply to take a power-law, namely

$$
F _ {\mathrm {T}} \left(\frac {\phi}{\chi}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac {\phi}{\chi}\right) ^ {2 n}. \tag {5.471}
$$

This leads to the potential studied in the next section. One remarks that for large values of the field,  $F_{\mathrm{T}}\{\tanh[\bar{\phi} / (\sqrt{6}M_{\mathrm{g}})]\}$  tends to a constant and, in this regime, the SO(1,1) symmetry is restored.

In Ref. [262], the model is also discussed in the framework of conformal supergravity, the action of which was given by Eq. (4.41). In that case, the embedding Kähler potential can be chosen as

$$
\mathcal {N} \left(X ^ {I}, \bar {X} ^ {\bar {I}}\right) = - \left| X ^ {0} \right| ^ {2} + \left| X ^ {1} \right| ^ {2} + | S | ^ {2} - 3 \zeta \frac {\left(S \bar {S}\right) ^ {2}}{\left| X ^ {0} \right| ^ {2} - \left| X ^ {1} \right| ^ {2}}. \tag {5.472}
$$

Here,  $X^0$  is a conformon,  $X^1 = \Phi$  is the inflaton and  $X^3 = S$  is a Goldstino and  $\zeta$  is a dimensionless parameter. The above Kähler potential has a SU(1,1) symmetry between the conformon and the inflaton. As it was the case in section 4.1, the last term, proportional to the parameter  $\zeta$ , is introduced to stabilize the inflationary trajectory. The superpotential is taken to be

$$
\mathcal {W} = S \left[ \left(X ^ {0}\right) ^ {2} - \left(X ^ {1}\right) ^ {2} \right] f \left(\frac {X ^ {1}}{X ^ {0}}\right), \tag {5.473}
$$

where, at this stage, the function  $f$  is arbitrary. It is interesting to emphasize the difference with the superconformal model of section 4.1. In that section, the embedding and superpotential were both given in terms of an exponential of the fields, leading to a power-law Kähler potential while, here, the embedding potential is expressed directly in terms of powers of the fields and, as a consequence, the corresponding Kähler potential will be given by a logarithm, a structure reminiscent of no scale supergravity.

Then, as usual, we fix the conformon field and choose the gauge where  $X^0 = \bar{X}^0 = \sqrt{3} M_{\mathrm{g}}$ . As a consequence, looking at Eqs. (4.42), the above choices imply that a (ordinary) supergravity description of the model can be expressed, as announced above, in terms of the following logarithmic Kähler potential

$$
K = - 3 M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2} \ln (1 + k), \tag {5.474}
$$

where  $k$  is a function given by

$$
k = - \frac {\Phi \bar {\Phi}}{3 M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}} - \frac {S \bar {S}}{3 M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}} + \frac {\zeta}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}} \frac {S ^ {2} \bar {S} ^ {2}}{3 M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2} - \Phi \bar {\Phi}}. (5. 4 7 5)
$$

The exact scalar potential corresponding to the theory we have just described is quite complicated. Indeed, as already mentioned several times, in general, it can be written as

$$
V = M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {4} e ^ {G} \left(G ^ {\bar {B} C} G _ {\bar {B}} G _ {C} - 3\right), \tag {5.476}
$$

with

$$
G = \frac {K}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}} + \ln \left(\frac {W W ^ {\dagger}}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {6}}\right). (5. 4 7 7)
$$

Expanding this formula, one obtains the following complicated expression

$$
\begin{array}{l} V = \frac {e ^ {K / M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}}}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}} G ^ {\bar {B} C} \left(\frac {W W ^ {\dagger}}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {4}} \frac {\partial K}{\partial \bar {X} ^ {\bar {B}}} \frac {\partial K}{\partial X ^ {C}} + \frac {W ^ {\dagger}}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}} \frac {\partial K}{\partial \bar {X} ^ {\bar {B}}} \frac {\partial W}{\partial X ^ {C}} + \frac {W}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}} \frac {\partial W ^ {\dagger}}{\partial \bar {X} ^ {\bar {B}}} \frac {\partial K}{\partial X ^ {C}} \right. \tag {5.478} \\ \left. + \frac {\partial W ^ {\dagger}}{\partial \bar {X} ^ {\bar {B}}} \frac {\partial W}{\partial X ^ {C}} - 3 W W ^ {\dagger}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

However, a crucial aspect of this scenario is that the superpotential, after symmetry breaking, can be expressed as

$$
W = S \left(3 M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2} - \Phi^ {2}\right) f \left(\frac {\Phi}{\sqrt {3} M _ {\mathrm {g}}}\right), \tag {5.479}
$$

and we notice that, as it was the case in section 4.1, this superpotential is again of the form  $W = Sf(\Phi)$ . Moreover, a fundamental remark made in Ref. [262] is that inflation takes place at  $S = 0$  and in the direction where  $\Phi$  is real. This greatly simplifies the calculations. Indeed, the simplification comes from the fact that, if  $S = 0$ , then  $W = 0$  and the previous expression for the scalar potential can be reduced to a compact formula, namely

$$
V = \frac {e ^ {K / M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}}}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}} G ^ {\bar {B} C} \frac {\partial W ^ {\dagger}}{\partial \bar {X} ^ {\bar {B}}} \frac {\partial W}{\partial X ^ {C}} = \frac {e ^ {K / M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}}}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2}} G ^ {\bar {S} S} \frac {\partial W ^ {\dagger}}{\partial \bar {S}} \frac {\partial W}{\partial S}. (5. 4 8 0)
$$

To go further, we must now calculate the Kähler matrix. Using Eq. (5.474), one obtains that

$$
G _ {A \bar {B}} = - \frac {3}{1 + k} \frac {\partial^ {2} k}{\partial X ^ {A} \partial \bar {X} ^ {\bar {B}}} + \frac {3}{(1 + k) ^ {2}} \frac {\partial k}{\partial X ^ {A}} \frac {\partial k}{\partial \bar {X} ^ {\bar {B}}}. \tag {5.481}
$$

It follows that, along the inflationary direction, the Kähler matrix can be simplified as

$$
G _ {A \bar {B}} = \frac {1}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {2} (1 + k) ^ {2}} \left( \begin{array}{c c} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 + k \end{array} \right). \tag {5.482}
$$

Given that, along the inflationary direction,  $k = -\Phi^2 /(3M_{\mathrm{g}}^2)$ , the above form of the Kähler matrix implies that the canonically normalized field  $\varphi$  is related to  $\Phi$  by the following formula

$$
\Phi = \sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {g}} \tanh  \left(\frac {\varphi}{\sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {g}}}\right). \tag {5.483}
$$

Finally, by noticing that  $\partial W / \partial S = 3M_{\mathrm{g}}^2 (1 + k)f$ , it follows that the potential of the canonically normalized field  $\varphi$  reads

$$
V (\varphi) = 9 M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {4} \left| f \left[ \tanh  \left(\frac {\varphi}{\sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {g}}}\right) \right] \right| ^ {2}. \tag {5.484}
$$

As a consequence, the T-model can be reproduced by choosing the function  $f$  appropriately, namely proportional to  $F_{\mathrm{T}}$  in Eq. (5.470).

# Slow-Roll Analysis

Going back to our usual notation for the inflaton, we now denote by  $\phi$  the canonically normalized field (noted  $\varphi$  in the previous section, and not be confused with the Jordan frame field of section 5.30.1).

The potential of the TMI can therefore be written as [541]

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ \tanh \left(\frac {\phi}{\sqrt {6} M _ {\mathrm {g}}}\right) \right] ^ {2 n}, (5. 4 8 5)
$$

and describes a one parameter model, the parameter being  $n$ .

From the above potential, we can obtain the Hubble flow functions. Defining  $x \equiv \phi / M_{\mathrm{g}}$ , one gets

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {4 n ^ {2}}{3} \sinh^ {- 2} \left(\frac {2 x}{\sqrt {6}}\right), \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \frac {8 n}{3} \frac {\cosh \left(\frac {2 x}{\sqrt {6}}\right)}{\sinh^ {2} \left(\frac {2 x}{\sqrt {6}}\right)}, \quad \epsilon_ {3} = \frac {2 n}{3} \frac {3 + \cosh \left(\frac {4 x}{\sqrt {6}}\right)}{\sinh^ {2} \left(\frac {2 x}{\sqrt {6}}\right) \cosh \left(\frac {2 x}{\sqrt {6}}\right)}. \tag {5.486}
$$

The potential and the Hubble-flow functions have been plotted in Fig. 55.

In this scenario, inflation stops by violation of the slow-roll conditions. This happens when  $\epsilon_{1} = 1$  corresponding to following vacuum expectation value of the field

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} = \frac {\sqrt {6}}{2} \operatorname {a r c s i n h} \left(\frac {2 n}{\sqrt {3}}\right). \tag {5.487}
$$

The slow-roll trajectory can be integrated and one gets

$$
N _ {\text {e n d}} - N = \frac {3}{4 n} \left[ \cosh \left(\frac {2 x}{\sqrt {6}}\right) - \cosh \left(\frac {2 x _ {\text {e n d}}}{\sqrt {6}}\right) \right]. \tag {5.488}
$$

This trajectory can be inverted leading to an explicit formula for  $\phi /M_{\mathrm{g}}$  during slow-roll inflation

$$
x = \frac {\sqrt {6}}{2} \operatorname {a r c c o s h} \left(\sqrt {1 + \frac {4 n ^ {2}}{3}} + \frac {4 n}{3} \Delta N\right), \tag {5.489}
$$

where  $\Delta N = N_{\mathrm{end}} - N$ . The value of  $x_*$ , namely the value of the field when the pivot scale crosses out the Hubble radius during inflation is given just given by the above expression with  $\Delta N = \Delta N_*$ .

Finally, the mass scale  $M$  that normalizes the potential can be expressed as

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {g}} ^ {4}} = \frac {1 9 2 0 \pi^ {2} n ^ {2}}{\sinh^ {2} \left(\frac {2 x _ {*}}{\sqrt {6}}\right) \left[ \tanh  \left(\frac {x _ {*}}{\sqrt {6}}\right) \right] ^ {2 n}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.490}
$$

The reheating consistent observable predictions for TMI have been represented in Fig. 167 for various values of  $n$ . One notices that the dependence on  $n$  of the spectral index and of the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very small. Indeed, provided the quantity  $n\Delta N$  dominates in Eq. (5.489), one has

$$
x _ {*} \simeq \frac {\sqrt {6}}{2} \operatorname {a r c c o s h} \left(\frac {4 n}{3} \Delta N _ {*}\right). \tag {5.491}
$$

Plugging this approximation into Eq. (5.486) gives

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} \simeq \frac {3}{4 \Delta N _ {*} ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2 *} \simeq \frac {2}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \quad \epsilon_ {3 *} \simeq \frac {1}{\Delta N _ {*}}, \tag {5.492}
$$

and the Hubble-flow functions are independent of  $n$  in the large  $\Delta N_{*}$  limit.
