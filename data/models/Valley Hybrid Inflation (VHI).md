# Valley Hybrid Inflation (VHI)

# Theoretical Justifications

Hybrid inflation is a two-fields model with the potential given by the following expression [221, 318, 418, 679-682]

$$
V (\phi , \psi) = \frac {1}{2} m ^ {2} \phi^ {2} + \frac {\lambda^ {\prime}}{4} (\psi^ {2} - \Delta^ {2}) ^ {2} + \frac {\lambda}{2} \phi^ {2} \psi^ {2}, \tag {7.20}
$$

where  $\phi$  is the inflaton,  $\psi$  the waterfall field,  $\lambda$  and  $\lambda'$  are two coupling constants and  $\Delta$  a constant of dimension one. A priori, given the above potential, inflation can occur in different regimes. However, the standard lore is that inflation can proceed along the valley given by  $\psi = 0$  and, in this case, the potential reduces to an effective single field potential that can be written as

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ 1 + \left(\frac {\phi}{\mu}\right) ^ {p} \right], \tag {7.21}
$$

with  $p = 2$  and where one has used the following parameter redefinition

$$
M = \frac {\lambda^ {\prime 1 / 4} \Delta}{\sqrt {2}}, \quad \mu = \sqrt {\frac {\lambda^ {\prime}}{2}} \frac {\Delta^ {2}}{m}. \tag {7.22}
$$

Inflation along the valley has been shown to be a dynamical attractor of the two-field dynamics in Refs. [683, 684]. However, as recently shown in Ref. [685], the hybrid potential can also support an inflationary phase along a mixed valley-waterfall trajectory, which is genuinely a two-fields dynamics. As we use a single field description here, those effects cannot be described by the potential of Eq. (7.21). For this reason, we will refer to the single field approximation as the "valley hybrid regime". Let us stress that, if the waterfall inflationary regime occurs, then it will erase any observable effects coming the valley hybrid regime. As a result, Eq. (7.21) is a good description of hybrid inflation only if the model parameters are such that the waterfall regime remains sub-dominant. According to Ref. [685, 686], this is the case provided

$$
\sqrt {\lambda^ {\prime}} \frac {\Delta^ {3}}{m} \ll M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}, \tag {7.23}
$$

a condition that will be assumed in the following. The effective potential (7.21) was also obtained in Ref. [687] in the context of supergravity brane inflation, and in Ref. [617] in the context of hilltop supernatural inflation. It depends on three parameters, namely  $M$ ,  $\mu$  and  $p$ . In fact, as mentioned before,  $p = 2$  for the two-field model given in Eq. (7.20) but we will consider the most general situation with  $p > 0$  unspecified. Let us stress again that all multifield effects such as the generation of isocurvature modes or cosmic strings cannot be accounted within the single field dynamics [205, 688-690].

It is also worth mentioning that the potential (7.21) with  $p = 2$  can also be obtained in the supergravity context [691-694]. The main idea is to consider a supergravity model which is not R-symmetry invariant and described by the following Kähler and super-potentials:

$$
K = X X ^ {\dagger} + \frac {b}{6 M ^ {2}} \left(X X ^ {\dagger}\right) ^ {2} - \frac {c}{9 M ^ {2}} X X ^ {\dagger} \left[ X ^ {2} + \left(X ^ {\dagger}\right) ^ {2} \right], \tag {7.24}
$$

$$
W = f X, \tag {7.25}
$$

Here  $X$  is a superfield,  $M < M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  a mass scale and  $b, c$  two dimensionless constants, a priori of order one. The quantity  $f$  is a constant of dimension two that can be viewed as the supersymmetry breaking scale. From these expressions, the scalar potential reads

$$
V = f ^ {2} \left[ 1 - \frac {2 b}{3 M ^ {2}} X X ^ {\dagger} + \frac {c}{3 M ^ {2}} \left(X ^ {2} + X ^ {\dagger 2}\right) + \mathcal {O} \left(\frac {1}{M ^ {4}}\right) \right], \tag {7.26}
$$

or, re-writing  $X = \alpha +i\beta$  , it reads

$$
V \simeq f ^ {2} \left[ 1 + \frac {2}{3 M ^ {2}} (b - c) \alpha^ {2} - \frac {2}{3 M ^ {2}} (b + c) \beta^ {2} \right]. \tag {7.27}
$$

For a field evolution along the  $\alpha$  direction, we recover a potential of the VHI type with  $p = 2$  ( $b - c$  must be positive). In this setup,  $\alpha / M \ll 1$  is required in order for the field  $\alpha$  to be approximately canonically normalized, the Kähler potential being not minimal. It is also interesting to comment on the  $\eta$ -problem in this model since this is a generic issue in supergravity. If one calculates the slow-roll parameter  $\eta \equiv M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 V_{\alpha \alpha} / V$ , one finds that

$$
\eta = \frac {4 M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{3 M ^ {2}} (b - c). \tag {7.28}
$$

Therefore, one must take  $M \lesssim M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  and fine-tune the difference  $b - c$  to a small number.

# Slow-Roll analysis

We now turn to the slow-roll analysis of the VHI scenario. Recall that we consider the following potential

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \left[ 1 + \left(\frac {\phi}{\mu}\right) ^ {p} \right], \tag {7.29}
$$

where the parameter  $M$  and  $\mu$  have been expressed in terms of the parameters of the two-field model in Eq. (7.22). The first three Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation can be derived from Eq. (7.29) in a straightforward fashion. Defining the quantity  $x$  by the following expression

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{\mu}, \tag {7.30}
$$

they read

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {p ^ {2}}{2} \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}\right) ^ {2} \frac {x ^ {2 p - 2}}{\left(1 + x ^ {p}\right) ^ {2}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2} = 2 p \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}\right) ^ {2} x ^ {p - 2} \frac {x ^ {p} - p + 1}{\left(1 + x ^ {p}\right) ^ {2}}, \tag {7.31}
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_ {3} = p \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}\right) ^ {2} x ^ {p - 2} \frac {2 x ^ {2 p} - (p - 1) (p + 4) x ^ {p} + (p - 1) (p - 2)}{\left(1 + x ^ {p}\right) ^ {2} \left(x ^ {p} - p + 1\right)}. \tag {7.32}
$$

A specific feature of hybrid inflation in comparison to large and small field models is that  $\epsilon_{2}$  and  $\epsilon_{3}$  can be negative (see Fig. 101). In particular

$$
\epsilon_ {2} \underset {x \rightarrow 0} {\simeq} - 2 p (p - 1) \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}\right) ^ {2} x ^ {p - 2}, \tag {7.33}
$$

and  $\epsilon_3$  blows up in the limit  $x^p\to p - 1$ . Together with the potential, the three Hubble flow functions have been represented in Fig. 101.

The slow-roll trajectory is obtained by integrating Eq. (3.11) with the valley hybrid potential and reads

$$
N - N _ {\text {e n d}} = \frac {1}{2 p} \frac {\mu^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left[ - x ^ {2} + x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2} + \frac {2}{2 - p} \left(x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2 - p} - x ^ {2 - p}\right) \right], \tag {7.34}
$$

which is, up to a sign, the same as for the SFI models [see Eq. (6.5)]. The case  $p = 2$  requires special attention, but as for SFI, is recovered as the limit  $p \to 2$  in the previous equation. One obtains

$$
N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = \frac {1}{4} \frac {\mu^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left[ - x ^ {2} + x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} - 2 \ln \left(\frac {x}{x _ {\mathrm {e n d}}}\right) \right], \tag {7.35}
$$

which is again very similar to SFI, up to a sign. The trajectory (7.34) cannot be inverted analytically in the general case. It is however possible to perform this inversion for many integer values of  $p$ , but those expressions will be omitted for the sake of clarity. We simply give an approximate solution valid only in the limit  $x \ll 1$  and  $p > 2$

$$
x \simeq \left[ x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2 - p} + p (p - 2) \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}} (N - N _ {\mathrm {e n d}}) \right] ^ {1 / (2 - p)}. \tag {7.36}
$$

If the waterfall inflation does not take place, i.e. under the condition (7.23), valley hybrid inflation ends by a tachyonic instability in the small field regime  $x < 1$ , also referred to as "the vacuum dominated regime". From the two-fields potential (7.20), one sees that the transverse direction becomes tachyonic at the inflaton value

$$
\phi_ {\mathrm {e n d}} = \sqrt {\frac {\lambda^ {\prime}}{\lambda}} \Delta . \tag {7.37}
$$

In the single field approach,  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  is therefore an extra-parameter and VHI is a three parameters model according to our classification. However, as can be seen in Fig. 101, one should pay attention to the various domains in which inflation can take place. They are given by the behavior of  $\epsilon_1(x)$ .

If  $p > 1$ , the slow-roll parameter  $\epsilon_{1}$  vanishes when the field goes to zero and at infinity while it reaches a maximum for

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {1} ^ {\max}} = (p - 1) ^ {1 / p}, \tag {7.38}
$$

equals to

$$
\epsilon_ {1} ^ {\max } = \frac {1}{2} \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}\right) ^ {2} (p - 1) ^ {\frac {2 p - 2}{p}}. \tag {7.39}
$$

Defining

$$
\mu_ {\epsilon} \equiv \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\sqrt {2}} (p - 1) ^ {1 - 1 / p}, \tag {7.40}
$$

for all  $\mu >\mu_{\epsilon}$ , one has  $\epsilon_1(x) < 1$  and inflation can proceed all over the domain  $x > 0$ . On the contrary, if  $\mu < \mu_{\epsilon}$ , then inflation can, a priori, proceed in two disconnected domains. Either  $0 < x < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^-$  or  $x > x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^+$  where  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^{\pm}$  are the two roots of  $\epsilon_1 = 1$ , i.e. the solutions of

$$
x ^ {2 p} + 2 x ^ {p} - \frac {p ^ {2}}{2} \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu}\right) ^ {2} x ^ {2 p - 2} + 1 = 0. \tag {7.41}
$$

This equation cannot be solved explicitly in the general case but, as for the trajectory, there are explicit analytic expressions for many integer values of  $p$ . For instance, for  $p = 2$ , one gets

$$
x _ {\epsilon_ {1} = 1} ^ {\pm (p = 2)} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\mu} \left(1 \pm \sqrt {1 - 2 \frac {\mu^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}}\right). \tag {7.42}
$$

The positive sign corresponds to the largest root while the minus one to the smallest (see Fig. 101). In the limit  $\mu \ll M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , one has  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^+ \simeq pM_{\mathrm{Pl}} / (\sqrt{2}\mu)$  which is also the expression of  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  for the large field model LFI (see section 5.2). This does not come as a surprise since in that situation Eq. (7.29) is indeed dominated by the monomial term. In fact, the two above-mentioned domains precisely correspond to a large field one for  $x > x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^+$  and a vacuum dominated one for  $x < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^-$ . It is a common mistake to assume that the large field domain remains unobservable due to the existence of the vacuum dominated one. In fact, as shown in Ref. [683], the large field regime becomes observable provided  $\mu \ll \mu_{\epsilon}$ . In that situation, after having crossed  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^+$ , the field fast-rolls in the region  $\epsilon_1(x) > 1$ . Then, it enters the domain  $x < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^-$  with a strong initial velocity and, as a consequence, crosses the whole vacuum dominated region, still in fast-roll, to reach  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . All observable predictions in such a situation are therefore similar to that obtained in the LFI models. Let us notice that, if there exists a mechanism that can gently put the field without a strong initial velocity inside the  $x < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^-$  domain, then inflation can still occur in the vacuum dominated region, even though  $\mu < \mu_{\epsilon}$ . But if the field is coming from the region  $x > x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^+$ , then this regime does not exist anymore.

For  $p = 1$ ,  $\epsilon_1(x)$  is a decreasing function of the field and takes a finite value  $M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2 / (2\mu^2)$  for  $x \to 0$ . The behavior is similar to the case  $p > 1$  and if  $\mu > M_{\mathrm{Pl}} / \sqrt{2}$  inflation can take place all over  $x > x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . However, if  $\mu < M_{\mathrm{Pl}} / \sqrt{2}$  then the vacuum dominated region does not exist anymore and  $x_{\epsilon_1 = 1} = x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^+ = M_{\mathrm{Pl}} / (\sqrt{2}\mu) - 1$ . One should also notice that if  $p = 1$  the relation  $\epsilon_2 = 4\epsilon_1$  applies.

Finally, for  $p < 1$ ,  $\epsilon_1(x)$  is a decreasing function of the field but it blows up when  $x \to 0$ . In that situation, inflation stops at  $x = \max(x_{\epsilon_1=1}^{-}, x_{\mathrm{end}})$  but the field will still fast-roll till the tachyonic instability develops at  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . As a result, even if for some cases  $x_{\epsilon_1=1}^{-} > x_{\mathrm{end}}$ , the observable predictions remain mostly the same.

According to the previous discussion, for  $p > 1$ , the VHI effective potential is therefore adequate to describe the vacuum dominated regime only, i.e. for  $x_{\mathrm{end}} < x < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^-$  where  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  is the instability point given by Eq. (7.37). In that situation, solving Eq. (3.48) together with the trajectory (7.34) gives the observable field value  $x_*$  at which the pivot mode crossed the Hubble radius during inflation. The potential parameter  $M$  is fixed from the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies

$$
\frac {M ^ {4}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {4}} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} p ^ {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}} \frac {x _ {*} ^ {2 p - 2}}{(1 + x _ {*} ^ {p}) ^ {3}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {7.43}
$$

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions are displayed in Figs. 339, 341, 343, 345 and 347 for  $p = 0.5$ ,  $p = 1$ ,  $p = 1.5$ ,  $p = 2$  and  $p = 3$ , respectively. For  $p > 1$  and  $x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}}} > 1$ ,  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  is varied between 0 and an upper bound such that  $x_{\mathrm{in}} < x_{\epsilon_1 = 1}^-$ . One the other hand, if  $x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}}} < 1$ , then one simply takes  $x_{\mathrm{end}} < 10$ . For  $p \leq 1$ ,  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  is varied on a wider range, with no particular constraints. For  $p = 1$ , the predictions lie on the line  $\epsilon_2 = 4\epsilon_1$  as expected whereas for  $p > 1$  one recovers a blue spectral index when  $x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}}} > 1$ , while a red spectral index can be obtained when  $x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}}} < 1$  and  $x_* > x_{\epsilon_1^{\mathrm{max}}}$ , with  $x_* < 1$  (that is to say, the large field regime).
