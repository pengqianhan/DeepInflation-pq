# Witten-O'Raifeartaigh Inflation (WRI)

# Theoretical Justifications

This model arises in different contexts and we now briefly review one of its theoretical motivation. The first situation originates from supersymmetric theories aimed at explaining the gauge hierarchy problem (that is to say why the GUT scale differs so much from the weak

scale). In the supersymmetric scenario of Ref. [517], three chiral superfields  $A$ ,  $X$  and  $Y$  are considered in a superpotential of the O'Raifeartaigh type [518],

$$
W = \lambda X \left(A ^ {2} - m ^ {2}\right) + g Y A, \tag {5.334}
$$

where  $m$  and  $g$  are constant of mass dimension. The corresponding (global) supersymmetric potential can be expressed as

$$
V = \lambda^ {2} | A ^ {2} - m ^ {2} | ^ {2} + g ^ {2} | A | ^ {2} + | 2 \lambda X A + g Y | ^ {2}. \tag {5.335}
$$

The minimum of this potential is given by  $\langle Y\rangle = -2\lambda \langle X\rangle \langle A\rangle /g$  and  $\langle A\rangle = 0$  [there is also another minimum at  $\langle A\rangle = \sqrt{m^2 - g^2 / (2\lambda^2)}$ ]. Clearly, the potential is minimized regardless of  $\langle X\rangle$ , that is to say we have a flat direction along  $X$ . Along that direction,  $V = \lambda^{2}m^{4}$  and supersymmetry is broken since  $F_{X}\equiv \partial W / \partial X\neq 0$ . As a consequence, the mass of the real part and imaginary parts of  $A$  are split and are given by  $4\lambda^{2}|X|^{2} + g^{2}\pm 2m^{2}\lambda^{2}$ . The mass of the fermion field  $\psi_{A}$  is  $4\lambda^{2}|X|^{2} + g^{2}$ . The fact that supersymmetry is broken implies that the potential will receive corrections: as is well-known, if supersymmetry is preserved, the corrections originating from bosons and fermions exactly cancel out. Here, this is not the case and the amplitude of the corrections will be determined by the split between the bosonic and fermionic masses that we have just evaluated before. A simple calculation leads to

$$
V = \lambda^ {2} m ^ {4} \left[ 1 + \frac {\lambda^ {2}}{8 \pi^ {2}} \ln \left(\frac {| X | ^ {2}}{\mu^ {2}}\right) \right], \tag {5.336}
$$

where  $\mu$  is the renormalization scale. Therefore, one obtains an increasing function of the field  $v\mathrm{e}v$  and this implies that  $X$  cannot become large because it cannot climb its potential. As a consequence, one cannot generate a large hierarchy in this scenario. In fact, as explained in Ref. [517], this is due to the fact that the one loop correction is positive, as appropriate in a theory with scalars and fermions. This can also be understood from the renormalization group perspective where the appearance of the logarithm in the above expression of  $V(X)$  can be viewed as the renormalization of the coupling constant such that  $\lambda^2\rightarrow \lambda^2\left[1 + \lambda^2 /(8\pi^2)\ln \left(|X|^2 /\mu^2\right)\right]$ . The conclusion of Ref. [517] is that if  $m$  is the small scale (the weak scale) and  $\langle X\rangle$  the large one (the GUT scale), a large hierarchy cannot be achieved in this approach.

However, it is well-known that asymptotic freedom is possible in non-Abelian gauge theories. This means that the renormalization group equations have to produce negative one loop corrections. In such a situation, the field could run to infinity, in the non-perturbative regime. For this reason, it is interesting to re-consider the previous model in the framework of a non-Abelian gauge group such as in Grand Unified SU(5) theories. Refs. [519, 520] consider two matter fields  $A_{a}^{b}$  and  $Z_{a}^{b}$  in the adjoint representation of SU(5) and one singlet  $X$  in a superpotential given by

$$
W = \lambda_ {1} \operatorname {T r} \left(Z A ^ {2}\right) + \lambda_ {2} X \left[ \operatorname {T r} \left(A ^ {2}\right) - m ^ {2} \right], \tag {5.337}
$$

which is the non-Abelian generalization of Eq. (5.334). One can show that supersymmetry is again necessarily broken<sup>6</sup> and that the potential exhibits a flat direction with the value

$V = \lambda_1^2\lambda_2^2 m^4 /(30\lambda_2^2 +\lambda_1^2)$ . As it was the case in the first simple example presented above, and since supersymmetry is broken, quantum corrections modify the potential. At the one loop order, one obtains the following expression [519]

$$
V (X) = \frac {\lambda_ {1} ^ {2} \lambda_ {2} ^ {2} m ^ {4}}{3 0 \lambda_ {2} ^ {2} + \lambda_ {1} ^ {2}} \left(1 + \frac {\lambda_ {2} ^ {2}}{\lambda_ {2} ^ {2} + \lambda_ {1} ^ {2} / 3 0} \frac {2 9 \lambda_ {1} ^ {2} - 5 0 g ^ {2}}{8 0 \pi^ {2}} \ln | X | ^ {2}\right), \tag {5.338}
$$

where  $g$  is the SU(5) gauge coupling constant. If  $29\lambda_1^2 < 50g^2$ , the correction is negative contrary to the case studied before. Again, this is precisely because we deal with non-Abelian gauge interaction. The field  $X$  will grow and can reach a point where the perturbative approach is no longer valid. However, asymptotic freedom tells us that the potential could develop a minimum in this regime in which  $X$  could be stabilized, hence the original motivation for this scenario: the scale  $m$  can be taken to be relatively small while  $\langle X\rangle$  can now be very large thereby addressing the gauge hierarchy problem.

This class of model was considered in Ref. [521] in order to build a new inflationary scenario. The idea is to start from a potential of the form derived above, namely  $V(\phi) = M^4\left(1 + \tilde{b}\ln \phi\right)$  with a negative coefficient  $\tilde{b}$ . Therefore, the field is driven towards a regime where higher corrections must become important. Typically, one expects  $\tilde{b}$  to acquire a logarithmic dependence in  $\phi$  and the potential to develop a minimum at, say  $\phi = m_{\mathrm{GUM}}$ . Therefore, this leads to  $V(\phi) = M^4\left[1 + b\ln^2 (\phi /m_{\mathrm{GUM}})\right]$  where  $b$  is a constant. Moreover, if one requires the potential to vanish at the minimum, we are led to  $V(\phi)\propto \ln^{2}(\phi /m_{\mathrm{GUM}})$  and this is the potential studied in this section. In Ref. [521], it is argued that  $m_{\mathrm{GUM}}\simeq M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$  and that, initially,  $\phi \simeq \mu \simeq (m_{\mathrm{weak}}m_{\mathrm{GUM}})^{1 / 2}\simeq 10^{12}\mathrm{GeV}$ . We will come back to these conditions in what follows.

Another way to obtain the same potential is based on Ref. [522, 523] in which one consider the following action

$$
S = - \int \mathrm {d} ^ {4} \boldsymbol {x} \sqrt {- g} \left[ \hat {g} _ {A \bar {B}} \left(z ^ {C}, \bar {z} ^ {\bar {C}}\right) g ^ {\mu \nu} \partial_ {\mu} z ^ {A} \partial_ {\nu} \bar {z} ^ {\bar {B}} - V \left(z ^ {C}, \bar {z} ^ {\bar {C}}\right) \right]. \tag {5.339}
$$

The  $z^{A}$ 's are complex scalar fields and  $\hat{g}_{A\bar{B}}$  is the Kähler metric. The corresponding equations of motion can be expressed as

$$
g ^ {\mu \nu} \nabla_ {\mu} \nabla_ {\nu} \bar {z} ^ {\bar {D}} + \Gamma_ {\bar {A} \bar {B}} ^ {\bar {D}} g ^ {\mu \nu} \partial_ {\mu} \bar {z} ^ {\bar {A}} \partial_ {\nu} \bar {z} ^ {\bar {B}} - \hat {g} ^ {C \bar {D}} \frac {\partial V}{\partial z ^ {C}} = 0, (5. 3 4 0)
$$

where  $\Gamma_{\bar{A}\bar{B}}^{\bar{D}}\equiv \hat{g}^{C\bar{D}}\partial_{\bar{A}}\hat{g}_{C\bar{B}}$ . If we restrict ourselves to cosmological spacetimes, the above equation becomes  $\ddot{\bar{z}}^{\bar{D}} + 3H\dot{z}^{\bar{D}} + \Gamma_{\bar{A}\bar{B}}^{\bar{D}}\dot{\bar{z}}^{\bar{A}}\dot{\bar{z}}^{\bar{B}} + \hat{g}^{C\bar{D}}\partial V / \partial z^{C} = 0$ , where  $H$  is the Hubble parameter. Then, for simplicity, we assume that there is only one field  $Z$  and we denote its real part as  $u$  and its imaginary part as  $v$ . We also assume that the potential is flat in the  $v$ -direction and take  $V = V(z + \bar{z})$ ,  $\hat{g}_{Z\bar{Z}}\equiv \hat{g} (Z + \bar{Z})$ . It follows that

$$
\ddot {u} + 3 H \dot {u} + \Gamma (u) (\dot {u} ^ {2} - \dot {v} ^ {2}) + \partial_ {u} V / (2 \hat {g}) = 0, \tag {5.341}
$$

$$
\ddot {v} + 3 H \dot {v} + 2 \Gamma (u) \dot {u} \dot {v} = 0, \tag {5.342}
$$

with  $\Gamma = \partial_u\hat{g} /(2\hat{g})$ . The second differential equation can be integrated and one obtains  $\dot{v} = Qa^{-3} / \hat{g}$ , where  $Q$  is a constant. The next step consists in defining the field  $\phi$  by  $\dot{\phi}\equiv \sqrt{\hat{g}}\dot{u}$ . As a consequence, the first differential equation can be re-written as  $\ddot{\phi} +3H\dot{\phi} +$ $\partial_{\phi}\left[V + Q^{2} / (\hat{ga}^{6})\right] = 0$ , that is to say  $\phi$  is now canonically normalized and its evolution is controlled by the effective potential  $V(\phi) + Q^2 /(\hat{ga}^6)$ . One can show that the presence of the additional term proportional to  $Q^2$  is not crucial [522, 523]. Initially, it dominates because  $a$  is small but, quickly, since it is proportional to  $a^{-6}$ , it goes to zero as the universe expands. As a consequence, one is left with  $V(\phi)$  only. A specific version of this scenario has been studied in details in Ref. [522]. In that article, it is assumed that  $\hat{g} = e^{-2u} / 2$  and  $V = 0$ . This corresponds to the bosonic action of a model which is superconformal invariant [524]. Then, this invariance is softly broken by adding a term  $m^2 u^2 /2$  and, through the redefinition of the field, one can check that this leads to a potential proportional to  $m^2 (\ln \phi)^2$ , that is to say of the type studied in this section. Moreover, one can also verifies that, in the regime discussed above where the term  $Q^2 /(\hat{ga}^6)$  dominates, an exact solution can be found and reads:  $a = a_0t^{1 / 3}$  and  $\phi^2 (t) = E^2 (\ln t + C)^2 +4Q^2 /(a_0^6 E^2)$ , where  $E$  and  $C$  are two integration constants. As a consequence, when the universe expands,  $Q^{2} / (\hat{ga}^{6})$  goes to zero and one is left with the logarithmic potential only.

# Slow-Roll Analysis

Based on the previous considerations, we study the WRI potential

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \ln^ {2} \left(\frac {\phi}{\phi_ {0}}\right), \tag {5.343}
$$

where  $\phi_0$  is viewed as a free parameter but we also keep in mind that a natural prior is  $\phi_0 = M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ . The potential Eq. (5.343) is displayed in Fig. 41, together with its logarithm (top panels). The arrow indicates that inflation proceeds from the right to the left. Let us now calculate the Hubble flow parameters. If one defines  $x \equiv \phi / \phi_0$ , they are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = 2 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {1}{x ^ {2} \ln^ {2} x}, \tag {5.344}
$$

$$
\epsilon_ {2} = 4 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {1 + \ln x}{x ^ {2} \ln^ {2} x}, \tag {5.345}
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_ {3} = 2 \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} \frac {2 + 3 \ln x + 2 \ln^ {2} x}{x ^ {2} \ln^ {2} x (1 + \ln x)}. \tag {5.346}
$$

They are displayed in the bottom panels of Fig. 41. One can see that they all vanish when  $x \to \infty$ , that they increase as inflation proceeds, diverging when  $x \to 1$ . At this stage, a remark is in order about Ref. [521]. As already mentioned above, a natural prior is  $\phi_0 = M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ . This means that if, initially, one has  $\phi \simeq \mu$ , one is in fact in the decreasing branch of the potential and, as a matter of fact, one cannot have inflation since  $\epsilon_1 > 1$  always. Clearly, the only way to have inflation in this branch is to assume that  $\phi_0 \gg M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , a case which appears to be difficult to justify in this context. Here, we do not consider this case. In the increasing branch of the potential, inflation stops by slow-roll violation when  $\epsilon_1 = 1$ , at a vev  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  given by

$$
x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} = \exp \left[ \mathrm {W} _ {0} \left(\sqrt {2} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) \right], \tag {5.347}
$$

where  $\mathrm{W}_0$  is the 0-branch of the Lambert function, which must be chosen in order to have  $x > 1$ .

Let us now turn to the slow-roll trajectory. It can be integrated exactly and this leads to the following expression

$$
N _ {\text {e n d}} - N = \frac {1}{4} \frac {\phi_ {0} ^ {2}}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}} \left(x ^ {2} \ln x - \frac {x ^ {2}}{2} - x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2} \ln x _ {\text {e n d}} + \frac {x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2}}{2}\right), \tag {5.348}
$$

where  $N_{\mathrm{end}}$  is the number of  $e$ -folds at the end of inflation. Interestingly enough, this trajectory can be inverted, and one obtains

$$
x = \exp \left\{\frac {1}{2} \mathrm {W} _ {0} \left[ \frac {8}{e} \frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}} ^ {2}}{\phi_ {0} ^ {2}} (N _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - N) + \frac {2}{e} x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2} \ln x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} - \frac {x _ {\mathrm {e n d}} ^ {2}}{e} \right] + \frac {1}{2} \right\}, \tag {5.349}
$$

where  $\mathrm{W_0}$  is still the 0-branch of the Lambert function. It is displayed in Fig. 42, together with the region where inflation proceeds.

Finally, it is interesting to constrain the value of the scale  $M$  with the CMB normalization. It follows that

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 2 8 8 0 \pi^ {2} \left(\frac {M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}{\phi_ {0}}\right) ^ {2} \frac {1}{x _ {*} ^ {2} \ln^ {4} x _ {*}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s - P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {5.350}
$$

The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions of the Witten- O'Raifeartaigh inflation models are displayed in Fig. 156. One should remember that in principle,  $\phi_0\simeq M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , even if a wider range of values for  $\phi_0$  is displayed in order to understand how the predictions depend on this parameter. In particular, when  $\phi_0\gg M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ , the predictions lie along the line  $\epsilon_{2} = 2\epsilon_{1}$ . Indeed, in this limit, Eq. (5.347) shows that  $x_{\mathrm{end}}\to 1$  while Eq. (5.349) indicates that  $x_{*}\rightarrow 1$ . As a consequence, one obtains  $\epsilon_{2*}\simeq \epsilon_{1*}$  from Eqs. (5.344) and (5.345).
