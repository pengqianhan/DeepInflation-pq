# $\beta$  Exponential Inflation (BEI)

This model was introduced and studied in Ref. [591] as a phenomenological generalization of the PLI exponential potential (see section 5.8). The potential is given by

$$
V (\phi) = M ^ {4} \exp_ {1 - \beta} \left(- \lambda \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right), \tag {6.180}
$$

where the generalized exponential function  $\exp_{1 - \beta}$  is defined by

$$
\exp_ {1 - \beta} (f) = \left\{ \begin{array}{c c} (1 + \beta f) ^ {1 / \beta} & \text {f o r} 1 + \beta f > 0, \\ 0 & \text {o t h e r w i s e .} \end{array} \right. \tag {6.181}
$$

As discussed in Ref. [591], for  $f > 0$  and  $g > 0$ , this function satisfies the following identities:

$$
\exp_ {1 - \beta} [ \ln_ {1 - \beta} (f) ] = f, \quad \ln_ {1 - \beta} (f) + \ln_ {1 - \beta} (g) = \ln_ {1 - \beta} (f g) - \beta [ \ln_ {1 - \beta} (f) \ln_ {1 - \beta} (g) ], \tag {6.182}
$$

where  $\ln_{1 - \beta}(f) = (f^{\beta} - 1) / \beta$  is the generalized logarithmic function. In the limit  $\beta \to 0$ , all the above expressions reproduce the usual exponential and logarithm properties. Therefore, the limit  $\beta \to 0$  reproduces the PLI potential (see section 5.8). However, as discussed below, this is not the case for the observable predictions which remain different. Defining the quantity  $x$  by

$$
x \equiv \frac {\phi}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}, \tag {6.183}
$$

the range of field  $vev$  for which inflation occurs depends on the sign of  $\beta$ . For  $\beta > 0$ , the field values are such that  $x < 1 / (\beta \lambda)$ , whereas if  $\beta < 0$ , the potential is defined for  $x > 1 / (\beta \lambda)$ . In both cases, inflation proceeds from the left to the right. The first three Hubble flow functions in the slow-roll approximation are given by

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = \frac {\lambda^ {2}}{2 (1 - \beta \lambda x) ^ {2}}, \qquad \epsilon_ {2} = \frac {2 \beta \lambda^ {2}}{(1 - \beta \lambda x) ^ {2}} = 4 \beta \epsilon_ {1}, \qquad \epsilon_ {3} = \epsilon_ {2}. \qquad (6. 1 8 4)
$$

Together with the potential, they are represented in Fig. 72.

One immediately sees that  $\epsilon_{1}$  is an increasing function of  $x$  only for the case where  $\beta > 0$ . Therefore inflation can naturally stop at  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  such that  $\epsilon_{1}(x_{\mathrm{end}}) = 1$ . In the opposite situation, namely  $\beta < 0$ , inflation has to be ended by some additional mechanism and  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$  would become an extra-parameter. Since this model is purely phenomenological, in the following, we restrict ourselves to the case  $\beta > 0$  for which

$$
x _ {\text {e n d}} = \frac {1}{\beta} \left(\frac {1}{\lambda} - \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}\right). \tag {6.185}
$$

The next step consists in determining the slow-roll trajectory. It can be integrated explicitly and the result reads

$$
N - N _ {\text {e n d}} = \frac {1}{\lambda} (x - x _ {\text {e n d}}) - \frac {\beta}{2} \left(x ^ {2} - x _ {\text {e n d}} ^ {2}\right). \tag {6.186}
$$

It can also be inverted and one obtains the following expression for  $x$  as a function of the  $e$ -folds number

$$
x = \frac {1}{\lambda \beta} - \sqrt {\left(x _ {\text {e n d}} - \frac {1}{\lambda \beta}\right) ^ {2} - \frac {2}{\beta} (N - N _ {\text {e n d}})}. \tag {6.187}
$$

Using these expressions, the observable field value  $x_{*}$  can be related to the number of  $e$ -folds  $\Delta N_{*} = N_{\mathrm{end}} - N_{*}$  at which the pivot scale crossed out the Hubble radius during inflation. Making use of Eq. (6.185), one gets

$$
x _ {*} = \frac {1}{\lambda \beta} - \sqrt {\frac {1}{2 \beta^ {2}} + \frac {2}{\beta} \Delta N _ {*}}. \tag {6.188}
$$

Inserting this expression into the slow-roll parameters formulas yields

$$
\epsilon_ {1 *} = \frac {1}{1 + 4 \beta \Delta N _ {*}}, \quad \epsilon_ {2 *} = \epsilon_ {3 *} = 4 \beta \epsilon_ {1 *}. \tag {6.189}
$$

Therefore, the slow-roll predictions of these models do not depend on the parameter  $\lambda$ . Moreover, the limit  $\beta \to 0$  does not give the same observable predictions as for the PLI models due to the singular behavior of  $x_{\mathrm{end}}$ . These models can therefore be viewed as a completely different class.

Finally, the amplitude of the CMB anisotropies fixes the parameter  $M$  with

$$
\left(\frac {M}{M _ {\mathrm {P l}}}\right) ^ {4} = 7 2 0 \pi^ {2} \lambda^ {2} \left(1 - \beta \lambda x _ {*}\right) ^ {- 2 - \frac {1}{\beta}} \frac {Q _ {\mathrm {r m s} - \mathrm {P S}} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}. \tag {6.190}
$$

Notice that, from Eq. (6.188), the above expression can be written in terms of  $\Delta N_{*}$  and that it does not depend on  $\lambda$  anymore. The reheating consistent slow-roll predictions for the BEI models are displayed in Fig. 208. The parameter  $\beta$  must be such that  $\beta \gtrsim 0.6$  in order for the predictions of the model to remain inside the two-sigma confidence intervals, while the parameter  $\lambda$  remains totally unconstrained.
